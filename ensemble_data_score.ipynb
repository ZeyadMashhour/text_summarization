       "\"Government and opposition parties have asked \\nKing Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election \\nnegotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party \\nto form a new government failed.Hun Sen's \\nCambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in \\nJuly's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form \\na government on its own.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's \\ntop political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress \\nin deadlocked negotiations to form a government.``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three \\nparties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such \\na meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an \\nOct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the \\nsenior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises \\nto end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to \\ntake responsibility before the nation and the people.''Hun Sen used \\nThursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil \\nwar to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with \\nhis party.``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability \\nprevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised \\nspeech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.Hun \\nSen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national \\nelection, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government \\non its own.Hun Sen said his current government would remain in \\npower as long as the opposition refused to form a new one.Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest \\nopposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, \\nRanariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating \\ninside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence \\nin Beijing.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, \\nand opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy \\nare out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman \\nHun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying \\nto make its members' return an international issue.Hun Sen's ruling \\nparty narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition \\n_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen \\nthe two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. \\nAfter a meeting \\nbetween Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen \\naide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for \\nthe opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international \\ncommunity may be asked for security guarantees.The opposition has insisted that any \\nfurther talks on the next government must take place outside the country, \\nbut the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and \\nrecently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. \\nLess than two weeks after abandoning hope that \\nhe could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is \\nnow ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of \\nthe three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. \\n \\nThe Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding \\nresolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives \\ncalling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian \\nlaw allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution \\ninclude Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince \\nNorodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against \\nanti-government demonstrations.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely \\nand realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice \\nto the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' \\nthe party said in a statement.It defended Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh \\nas a proper response to the prince's attempts at the time to negotiate \\nthe defections of senior Khmer Rouge rebels.The killings of nearly 100 of \\nRanariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in \\nthe aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications \\nmeant to distort the political situation.The ruling party supported the police action \\nin its statement, noting that public property was damaged by protesters \\nand that grenades were thrown at Hun Sen's home after Sam Rainsy suggested \\nin a speech that the U.S. government should fire cruise missiles at \\nHun Sen.``The leaders of illegal demonstrations \\nare the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving \\nfrom the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly \\nviolence as ``minor incidents.''Disputes over the \\npresidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the \\ntwo-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form \\na new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has \\noffered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC \\nparty of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.``No party with \\nseats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency \\nand a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the \\nstatement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given \\nchairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions.Noting \\nthat FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its \\nwin in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its \\nturn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, \\nHun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was \\nshort of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. \\nHun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh \\nto return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make \\nan ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a \\ngovernment.In a \\nlong-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh \\nwill become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed \\nelections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of \\n64 seats in the 122-member chamber.``The major political \\ncrisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock \\nfacing the nation has also come to an end,'' the king said in his \\nstatement.The senior Senate leaders will join \\nthose of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two \\nBuddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that \\nwill choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the \\nCPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors \\nand businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which \\nis in desperate need of aid.Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership \\nbetween the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom \\nRanariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. \\nHun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in \\n1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over \\npower-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling \\nKhmer Rouge.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to \\na coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh \\npresident of the National Assembly.Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom \\nof all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they \\nwill be arrested or killed if they return to the country.The assurances \\nwere aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun \\nSen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices \\nin September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind \\na plot against his life.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father \\nand Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, \\nHun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied \\nto all politicians.``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members \\nof the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' \\nthe opposition leader said in a statement.Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, \\nthe prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning \\nof ministries in the new coalition government.Last week, Hun Sen's \\nCambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to \\nform a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and \\nmake the prince president of the National Assembly.Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, \\nopposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of \\nsecurity guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote \\nin a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the \\nfirst session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained \\nthat Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns \\nhis party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC \\nparty finished a close second in the election, returned last week \\nand struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The two parties have formed three working \\ngroups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment \\nof a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.In a short letter sent to news \\nagencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements \\nsigned Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party \\nin firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. \\nThe deal, which will make Hun Sen \\nprime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended \\nmore than three months of political deadlock that followed a July \\nelection narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation \\nof a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President \\nChea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC \\nhad agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat \\nNational Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much \\npower it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet \\nto be ironed out by the two parties. \\n\""

       "\"\\nHonduras braced for potential catastrophe Tuesday as Hurricane Mitch \\nroared through the northwest Caribbean, churning up high waves and \\nintense rain that sent coastal residents scurrying for safer ground. \\nPresident Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of maximum alert \\nand the Honduran military sent planes to pluck residents from their \\nhomes on islands near the coast.Mitch posed no immediate threat to the United States, forecasters \\nsaid, but was expected to remain in the northwest Caribbean for five \\ndays.The Honduran \\npresident closed schools and public offices on the coast Monday and \\nordered all air force planes and helicopters to evacuate people from \\nthe Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the country's \\ncentral coast.The head of the Honduran armed forces, Gen. Mario Hung \\nPacheco, said 5,000 soldiers were standing by to help victims of the \\nstorm, but he warned the military could not reach everyone.Mexico mobilized troops and \\nemergency workers Monday on the east coast of the Yucatan peninsula, \\nwhich was also under a hurricane watch, and Cuba said it had evacuated \\n600 vacationers from the Island of Youth.Jerry Jarrell, the weather \\ncenter director, said Mitch was the strongest hurricane to strike \\nthe Caribbean since 1988, when Gilbert killed more than 300 people. \\n``If \\nit gets really bad, we'll go to the church and see what the architect \\nof the world has in store for us.''In El Progreso, \\n100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, \\nthe army evacuated more than 5,000 people who live in low-lying banana \\nplantations along the Ulua River, said Nolly Soliman, a resident. \\nRain squalls flooded streets in the Jamaican capital, \\nKingston, and government offices and schools closed in the Caymans, \\na British colony of 28,000 people.Hurricane Mitch paused in its whirl through the western Caribbean \\non Wednesday to punish Honduras with 120-mph (205-kph) winds, topping \\ntrees, sweeping away bridges, flooding neighborhoods and killing at \\nleast 32 people.It also was \\nonly 30 miles (50 kms) off the coast, and hurricane-force winds stretched \\noutward 105 miles (165 kms); tropical storm-force winds 175 miles \\n(280 kms).``The hurricane has destroyed almost \\neverything,'' said Mike Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island which \\nwas within miles (kms) of the eye of the hurricane.At its, 4th graf pvs \\n \\nHurricane Mitch cut through the Honduran coast like a ripsaw Thursday, \\nits devastating winds whirling for a third day through resort islands \\nand mainland communities.The storm's power was easing and by 1200 GMT, \\nit had sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph), down from 100 mph (160 \\nkph) around midnight and well below its 180 mph (290 kph) peak of \\nearly Tuesday.After remaining virtually stationary for more than \\na day, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Thursday the center \\nof the 350-mile-wide (560-kilometer-wide) storm had moved slightly \\nto the south but remained just off the Honduran coast.Hurricane-force \\nwinds whirled up to 30 miles (50 kilometers) from the center, with \\nrain-laden tropical storm winds extending well beyond that.Caught \\nnear the heart of the storm were the Bay Islands, about 25 miles (40 \\nkilometers) off Honduras' coast and popular with divers and beachcombers. \\n``The hurricane has destroyed almost everything,'' said Mike Brown, \\na resident of Guanaja Island, 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the coast. \\nWhile supplies of food and gasoline \\nseemed to hold up, drivers worried about the coming days formed long \\nlines to fill their tanks at gas stations and some supermarkets took \\nmeasures to limit panic buying.In neighboring Belize, most of the 75,000 residents of coastal Belize \\nCity had left by Wednesday, turning the country's largest city into \\na ghost town.With the storm seemingly \\nanchored off Honduras, officials in Mexico to the north eased emergency \\nmeasures on the Caribbean coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, where hundreds \\nof people remained in shelters as a precaution Wednesday night.At its peak, Mitch was the fourth-strongest Caribbean hurricane in \\nthis century, behind Gilbert in 1988, Allen in 1980 and the Labor \\nDay hurricane of 1935. \\n \\nAt least 231 people have been confirmed dead in Honduras from former-hurricane \\nMitch, bringing the storm's death toll in the region to 357, the National \\nEmergency Commission said Saturday.In the Caribbean, \\nthe U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a tourist schooner with \\n31 people aboard that hasn't been heard from since Tuesday.By late \\nSunday, Mitch's winds, once near 180 mph (290 kph), had dropped to \\nnear 30 mph (50 kph), and the storm _ now classified as a tropical \\ndepression _ was near Tapachula, on Mexico's southern Pacific coast \\nnear the Guatemalan border.Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said Sunday night that between \\n1,000 and 1,500 people were buried in a 32-square mile (82.88 square-kilometer) \\narea below the slopes of the Casita volcano in northern Nicaragua. \\nBRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Tuesday approved 6.4 \\nmillion European currency units (dlrs 7.7 million) in aid for thousands \\nof victims of the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch in Central \\nAmerica.EU spokesman Pietro Petrucci said the funds will be used \\nto provide basic care such as medicine, food, water sanitation and \\nblankets to thousands of people whose homes were destroyed by torrential \\nrains and mudslides.Pope John Paul II appealed for aid Wednesday for the Central American \\ncountries stricken by hurricane Mitch and said he feels close to the \\nthousands who are suffering.Speaking during his general audience, \\nthe pope urged ``all public and private institutions and all men of \\ngood will'' to do all they can ``in this grave moment of destruction \\nand death.''Better information from Honduras' ravaged countryside enabled officials \\nto lower the confirmed death toll from Hurricane Mitch from 7,000 \\nto about 6,100 on Thursday, but leaders insisted the need for help \\nwas growing.She later will stop in El Salvador and Guatemala before continuing \\non to Haiti and the Dominican Republic for a visit that had been canceled \\ndue to Hurricane Georges, which struck the Caribbean in October.the \\ndepartments of Cortes, Atlantida, Colon and Yoro in the north, southern \\nCholuteca and Valle, and the central department of Francisco Morazan, \\nwhich includes the capital.In the flood-ravaged Tegucigalpa neighborhood \\nof Nueva Esperanza, Mexican military rescuers loaded search dogs on \\ntheir backs and forded a muddy river to look for people believed buried \\nin a 200-foot (60-meter) avalanche that occurred last Friday.Concerned that crowded \\nshelter conditions could produce outbreaks of hepatitis, respiratory \\ninfections and other ailments, the Health Ministry announced an inoculation \\ncampaign, especially for children.Doctors volunteering at a shelter \\nhousing 4,000 people at Tegucigalpa's Polytechnic Development Institute \\nsaid they'd heard of the campaign but had yet to receive word or medicines \\nfrom the Health Ministry.``We have to vaccinate the children,'' said \\nDr. Mario Soto, who has treated at least 300 children at the shelter \\nfor diarrhea, conjunctivitis and bacterial infections. \\n \\nAid workers struggled Friday to reach survivors of Hurricane Mitch, \\nwho are in danger of dying from starvation and disease in the wake \\nof the storm that officials estimate killed more than 10,000 people. \\nForeign aid and pledges of assistance poured into Central America, \\nbut damage to roads and bridges reduced the amount of supplies reaching \\nhundreds of isolated communities to a trickle: only as much as could \\nbe dropped from a helicopter, when the aircraft can get through.A score of cargo aircraft landed Thursday at the normally \\nquiet Toncontin airport in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, delivering \\naid from Mexico, the United States, Japan and Argentina.Former U.S. \\nPresident Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, intended to visit Nicaragua \\non Friday to learn more about the hurricane's impact, The Carter Center \\nin Atlanta announced.\""
