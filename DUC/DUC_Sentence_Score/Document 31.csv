many democrats are straddling a line that seems to shift a bit with every new scandal related disclosure they do not want to appear close to a president whose conduct embarrasses them and yet sensing the possibility of a public backlash against republicans they are weighing their words carefully and are wary of hopping on any impeachment bandwagon.,162,0.0016060122496375452,168,0.022207372208738817,0.002620289443548387,0.9639183418426576

ms. boyle a former commissioner in cuyahoga county which encompasses cleveland is crisscrossing the nation s seventh most populous state in what she describes as a grass roots campaign that while operating on a comparative shoestring has nonetheless attracted to her side nationally known democrats president clinton foremost among them on the campaign trail.,352,0.0020906199798157543,218,0.19385879488900534,0.002612231495504149,0.9745845459904112

like many candidates this year ms. boyle is campaigning hard on the issue of education seeking to portray voinovich as a lackluster steward who allowed the state s schools to decline.,183,0.0039359638856181255,106,0.4444755232253658,0.002694395217306748,0.9546876389841856

the northern half of the state with its history of industrial unionized cities has a tradition of voting largely for democratic candidates while the southern tier of the state is considered more conservative and typically leans republican.,214,0.0019297790985425354,146,0.09863768936987885,0.002582364827755753,0.9667899290681332

one of the central questions of this political year has been how clinton s dealings with ms. lewinsky might affect turnout.,125,0.002637634159367219,65,0.1516145031301468,0.0026137850818362418,0.9320065126113568

a d amato endorsement would also weaken schumer s efforts to portray the incumbent as a right wing extremist and would signify to many voters a fraying of the traditional democratic coalition that has included black and gay voters women and labor unions.,307,0.0025826744325503016,145,-0.0931609163949598,0.0025568016472590042,0.9676787014501086

many new york gay activists would also be deeply upset if the group endorses d amato whom they blame for installing the state senate majority leader joseph bruno whom they consider to be strongly anti gay. matt foreman executive director of the empire state pride agenda cited d amato s role as the architect of the state republican party as a major reason the group endorsed schumer.,734,0.004486377002508828,227,-0.0910513324909684,0.002643975674623729,0.9804114960929909
