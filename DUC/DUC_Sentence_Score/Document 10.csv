none of the aid groups has been able to study the issue of hunger related deaths and the north koreans have not released relevant figures although most experts agree that probably more than one million and perhaps as many as three million have died prematurely since the food shortages began.,269,0.007427294248102997,124,0.2153047807731158,0.004983220367014448,0.9667933914392112
but public health experts say the number who have perished might be difficult to tally in any case because most deaths were probably not from quick starvation but from immune systems weakened by years of hunger so that common colds more easily give way to lethal pneumonia and an ordinary bout of infectious diarrhea proves fatal.,71,0.0033249114109445066,171,-0.02837972673560863,0.0046215995852517755,0.9731042730767344
