brazil is very important to the economic well being of the region the united states and the international community and all of us are very much focused on seeing how we can be helpful treasury secretary robert rubin said on friday.,173,0.0048179433270513095,109,-0.07308909055825484,0.003930360951116025,0.9548088136796089

direct u.s. aid to brazil would clearly send a symbolic message that after a year of trying to manage the financial crisis through the monetary fund the united states is now ready to put a limited amount of its own capital at risk to prevent further havoc not only for brazil but to stop chaos spreading to argentina mexico and other countries that are major u.s. trading partners.,327,0.0036960802213523744,190,-0.09046217175640904,0.004131594282736673,0.9751121866611494

by acting soon to stabilize latin america the administration is hoping to capitalize on two weeks of relative calm after the late summer panic that engulfed russia and at its height led to an outflow of a billion dollars a day from brazil for fear that it would be the next country forced to devalue its currency.,224,0.003607738389924504,165,-0.09914187523994487,0.004067549199829407,0.973444738186485
