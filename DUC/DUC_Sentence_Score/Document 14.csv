michael lacovara a microsoft lawyer who was questioning a government witness economist frederick warren boulton suggested to him during the trial monday that the proposed acquisition undermined warren boulton s argument that microsoft seems headed toward obtaining a monopoly in internet browser software to match the one it apparently holds in operating systems.,559,0.0027920287587453697,236,-0.24843623386353897,0.0026462620844758668,0.9765880332076184

lacovara then asked warren boulton the question that lay under his entire cross examination of the witness and microsoft s larger assertion monday about the proposed netscape aol deal.,396,0.0032536889482885057,115,-0.21193508209190684,0.0025873761906587615,0.9617432291274602
surely this combination he asked tells you something about the nature of competition in the software industry warren boulton s answer was probably not the one lacovara had been after.,115,0.0016021051398219168,84,-0.07776139171140165,0.0025560434546572637,0.9400154614449102
to the extent that this potential merger is the result of microsoft s actions with these exclusive contracts and other actions he said it is unfortunate to see the disappearance of a firm like netscape the brightest newest star.,271,0.0010124751458522071,117,-0.07903298715767235,0.002624724993822709,0.9589053967433806

by moving quickly toward what both companies have recently come to see as the inevitable convergence of technology and media america online hopes that it will secure a solid lead in a battle already joined by giants like the microsoft corp. and the international business machines corp. to transform the greater part of cyberspace into a vast virtual mall.,423,0.0020762814539692135,200,0.03196789127214778,0.0027197857021331387,0.5994985323588141
