a sticking point for white house and congressional budget negotiators has been the issue of how the census will be conducted and the white house is finding itself negotiating on the issue as much with house democrats as it is with the house republican leaders.,628,0.007856335971231584,130,-0.16693452417901045,0.003031202496862434,0.9608851942729275

but house democrats balked at the idea of six months financing for the census arguing that even if the supreme court allowed sampling the republicans would be under no obligation to approve money for a census that included sampling.,282,0.004138124978906682,122,-0.05692961711280517,0.0030028839139485523,0.7959223251240087

statistical sampling would allow the census bureau to estimate populations that are difficult to count and would have the largest effect on the counting of african americans in cities and blacks and hispanics in rural areas groups that are traditionally undercounted by the standard means.,68,0.0017708973010372691,161,-0.02571136161369695,0.0027337310291052413,0.9706352873125271
republicans fear and democrats hope that the method would raise the count of people living in traditionally democratic areas giving the party an advantage when new boundaries for election districts are drawn following the census.,165,0.0033635648522413026,133,-0.05574989215249999,0.0029916910690955018,0.9635062080804842

the willingness of house democrats including gephardt to press the president on the issue represents a realization of their leverage with clinton who will need all of their support in the coming impeachment inquiry.,258,0.0026419900104702582,123,-0.07394487062503723,0.0030165425035048447,0.956871676912732

as it passed both the house and the senate it allowed for health plans with religious affiliation to decline to offer contraceptive coverage coburn wants plans to be able to refuse such coverage on moral grounds as well.,211,0.0036373923305792607,118,0.5674139468036633,0.003028582186984127,0.5407976405603863

the question is whether the white house will insist on keeping the contraceptive coverage in the final package and will oppose the moral exception.,233,0.004492252702492165,81,0.15645764884212518,0.0030436518171425187,0.939711745315023

some conservatives sounded notes of discord friday over the federal spending agreement but they also said they would probably vote for the billion package because it boosted defense spending and provided aid to farmers.,195,0.0038399178451939426,113,-0.0276643674917726,0.0030353634856419374,0.5718800184224923

in and when politicians staked their careers on striking a budget deal to lower the deficit the fundamental question was how to divide up the bitter medicine of more taxes and less spending.,118,0.002230268491185578,96,-0.038055405532948644,0.0030089251546824127,0.9550999937082859

this year with democrats and republicans alike claiming victory the burning issue was how to parcel out the candy.,160,0.0016897242220260957,61,-0.0657005609961696,0.002922355181341684,0.9347846911539043

but much of the money like the million that will pay for six new helicopters for the national police in colombia to use in drug interdiction was designated emergency spending simply because there was no other way to get it into the budget.,141,0.0015761812180888353,101,-0.022228978176492577,0.0028587334610944704,0.9544147245206761

the other big difference is that the principal fights this year were not over money at all.,87,0.0036090591291408204,36,-0.08170275384386941,0.002900862869734208,0.7694923508102357

some conservatives sounded notes of discord friday over the federal spending agreement but they also said they would probably vote for the billion package because it boosted defense spending and provided aid to farmers.,195,0.0038399178451939426,113,-0.0276643674917726,0.0030353634856419374,0.5718800184224923

almost everyone on capitol hill expects the budget to pass eventually with the biggest defections coming from conservatives who object to the billion taken from the surplus to address so called emergencies and for the package s failure to offer voters a serious tax cut.,158,0.0037628127259126433,135,-0.046196292484620025,0.0030876678955290273,0.9677921141196703
