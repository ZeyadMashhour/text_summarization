the justice department says that the bundling of explorer with windows and the inclusion of the browser as part of windows amount to tying an illegal practice that forces customers of one product to purchase another.,347,0.002806534854401336,115,0.0861391132082224,0.0017961973879269655,0.7807208763661729
the contracts with manufacturers and internet services are illegal the government says because they are intended not only to create a monopoly in the browser market but to protect microsoft s existing monopoly in operating systems.,694,0.0027583751490464613,129,-0.13791349828347788,0.0017670298343756066,0.9588413841915169

many antitrust experts say the problem facing the justice department is that the courts have provided no clear definition of tying and no clear guidelines for determining when contracts are illegally exclusionary.,228,0.0017385745715833762,125,0.2732033173105598,0.0017526497401946619,0.9576124224051233
professor lawrence white of new york university who was chief economist of the justice department s antitrust division in the early s says that the courts treat tying as an unusual practice when in fact it is ubiquitous.,290,0.002185750963285355,131,0.25800432109691085,0.0016824197876375297,0.9635170253212317

his point shared widely among economists is that some tying benefits consumers if for example it results in products that are easier to use or enables a company to recover development costs.,102,0.0014974685294184842,95,0.1676477378980062,0.0017713205135754047,0.9514398104710314

the courts white says have not offered enough guidance for distinguishing good tying from bad which is the nub of the legal dispute.,55,0.001645466228747512,59,0.16010893431052942,0.0017405834969288871,0.940227690096329
microsoft says it needs only to show that bundling windows and explorer passes what might be called a gross consumer benefits test that it offers an immediate benefit whether or not it causes long term damage to competition and therefore ultimately to consumers.,518,0.0021589645809793707,121,0.27639950028992727,0.0018161622996714574,0.5129688424306899
the justice department says that microsoft s practices must clear a higher hurdle yielding net consumer benefits that are immediate and large enough to balance possible long term harm to competition.,596,0.002046914213690393,107,0.3271405507702202,0.0018063888213033187,0.9608154488889549
so which test of consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws the simple answer is that no one knows for sure which is why both sides can reasonably cite the same cases without fear of embarrassment.,141,0.0021014895417759815,79,0.33164428121080625,0.0017485646326949184,0.9471212175094872

the supreme court ruled that aspen skiing had violated antitrust laws because there was no evidence its action helped consumers.,194,0.0025260231270601776,72,0.39659603223758894,0.001698926685645481,0.5069621779567121

indeed in aspen skiing the court even forced the monopolist to do business with its rival a precedent that augurs well for the justice department which seeks to force microsoft to install netscape s browser alongside its own.,838,0.0025026837871003982,125,0.1068730865107066,0.0017826971765177331,0.6306518528055554

besides he says unlike the actions taken by the lorain journal or aspen skiing microsoft s contracts do not prevent consumers from installing netscape s browser or from using the web sites of microsoft s rivals.,929,0.002501154040553307,107,0.022412714134903915,0.0017064186048625926,0.6194135449828525

yet the court said a hospital with monopoly power would still not be allowed to force surgical patients to use its panel of anesthesiologists if consumers wanted to purchase the two services separately.,127,0.0015891115338982876,109,0.1315640017718699,0.0017404186650697908,0.9537095839537552

the justice department s rejoinder is to note that the sole purpose of antitrust law is to protect consumers so it makes no sense to bless practices that provide a dollar s worth of benefits today but by stamping out competition drive prices up by tomorrow.,289,0.0018786747609423314,154,0.2636984132993785,0.0018081920434333443,0.9716821211189499
the justice department will ask the court to at least insist that monopolists use the least exclusionary means possible to achieve whatever services they provide customers.,231,0.0021893827148914747,83,0.2662598713325641,0.0017312355644334512,0.9399455450932067

under this standard a contract is illegal only if it is intended to drive out competition and thus to pave the way for a monopolist to raise prices later.,105,0.0010459508881033885,69,0.03501328451916537,0.0016982572109323175,0.9336727591264368
microsoft will have an easier time defending itself against a charge of predation which amounts to victimizing its customers than it would defending itself against a charge that its bundled product does consumers slightly more harm than good.,471,0.0014374905196276652,110,0.11858983030597274,0.0017453546228479496,0.9562156898271459

many antitrust experts say the problem facing the justice department is that the courts have provided no clear definition of tying and no clear guidelines for determining when contracts are illegally exclusionary.,228,0.0017385745715833762,125,0.2732033173105598,0.0017526497401946614,0.9576124224051233
professor lawrence white of new york university who was chief economist of the justice department s antitrust division in the early s says that the courts treat tying as an unusual practice when in fact it is ubiquitous.,290,0.002185750963285355,131,0.25800432109691085,0.0016824197876375297,0.9635170253212317

his point shared widely among economists is that some tying benefits consumers if for example it results in products that are easier to use or enables a company to recover development costs.,102,0.0014974685294184842,95,0.1676477378980062,0.0017713205135754047,0.9514398104710314

the courts white says have not offered enough guidance for distinguishing good tying from bad which is the nub of the legal dispute.,55,0.001645466228747512,59,0.16010893431052942,0.0017405834969288871,0.940227690096329
microsoft says it needs only to show that bundling windows and explorer passes what might be called a gross consumer benefits test that it offers an immediate benefit whether or not it causes long term damage to competition and therefore ultimately to consumers.,518,0.0021589645809793707,121,0.27639950028992727,0.0018161622996714579,0.5129688424306899
the justice department says that microsoft s practices must clear a higher hurdle yielding net consumer benefits that are immediate and large enough to balance possible long term harm to competition.,596,0.002046914213690393,107,0.3271405507702202,0.0018063888213033187,0.9608154488889549
so which test of consumer benefits satisfies antitrust laws the simple answer is that no one knows for sure which is why both sides can reasonably cite the same cases without fear of embarrassment.,141,0.002101489541775981,79,0.33164428121080625,0.0017485646326949181,0.9471212175094872

indeed in aspen skiing the court even forced the monopolist to do business with its rival a precedent that augurs well for the justice department which seeks to force microsoft to install netscape s browser alongside its own.,838,0.0025026837871003982,125,0.1068730865107066,0.0017826971765177331,0.6306518528055554

yet the court said a hospital with monopoly power would still not be allowed to force surgical patients to use its panel of anesthesiologists if consumers wanted to purchase the two services separately.,127,0.0015891115338982876,109,0.1315640017718699,0.0017404186650697908,0.9537095839537552

the justice department s rejoinder is to note that the sole purpose of antitrust law is to protect consumers so it makes no sense to bless practices that provide a dollar s worth of benefits today but by stamping out competition drive prices up by tomorrow.,289,0.0018786747609423314,154,0.2636984132993785,0.0018081920434333443,0.9716821211189499

in a letter to the justice department netscape said that microsoft was using its dominance in personal computer operating systems to force or persuade computer makers to favor microsoft s browser used to explore the world wide web over the one marketed by netscape.,1323,0.003829353796153191,160,-0.16482691899965646,0.0018093223430263878,0.8802713739851061

it seemed like a slam dunk violation of the consent decree a natural extension of that case recalled litan who had left the department by then.,174,0.0008332705578768187,75,0.08452970390274606,0.0016147400642562899,0.9454865449373909

in the meantime last may the justice department and state attorneys general filed their new suit against microsoft which is scheduled for trial on monday.,544,0.0022621065904766136,81,0.15555178570374967,0.0017122463973620486,0.9460039747230913
it contends that microsoft has engaged in bundling tying and other predatory behavior similar in many ways to the numerous previous allegations and investigations of the last nine years.,356,0.0013621227875511655,101,0.031170961712761958,0.0017713110028962197,0.8446692143679675
a good part of this case is just round ii of the case we dealt with in round i in the early in the s litan said.,229,0.001360762489189332,42,0.0759323900033177,0.00170529600678144,0.6984352968167971

shortly before the government filed its antitrust suit against microsoft corp. in may joel klein the assistant attorney general in charge of the justice department s antitrust division met with a silicon valley executive.,792,0.0038901074012166444,146,0.16062976270036597,0.0017052623613771402,0.603091504182115
the executive recalls telling klein that unless a case went beyond the internet browser market it would have little effect on microsoft s power to stifle competition across the computer industry.,768,0.003389087245052179,102,-0.07039509104159536,0.0018234593863250392,0.9552508512651029

but he said time was running short and the strongest evidence in hand involved microsoft s battle against netscape communications corp. in the market for the so called browser software used for navigating the internet.,742,0.0029082433678481413,119,-0.10096138722589555,0.0018139841172078496,0.9558470720121925

but five months later the case that the government is bringing to trial on monday extends well beyond netscape and the browser war to embrace what it described in a recent court filing as a broad pattern of anti competitive conduct by microsoft.,797,0.0018553405398548332,124,0.06791937785765012,0.0018288371470946588,0.7777334928419221

in bringing a more ambitious complicated case to trial than the one it filed in may the government has chosen a high risk strategy.,199,0.0012540099288749396,70,0.08163884736053674,0.0017835686303611941,0.9397186089867463
the law states that new evidence can be added to a suit after it is filed but not new charges.,80,0.002620901661693266,33,0.13288231765019812,0.0017174165846335044,0.9094273577697838
and so in his federal courtroom in washington u.s.district judge thomas penfield jackson could decide to rule out some of the new evidence as ranging too far afield from the original suit.,129,0.001676815586131151,101,0.11778289040115975,0.0016213882854098649,0.9565166323552536

the government has doubled the bet and doubled the stakes said david yoffie a professor at the harvard business school who is co author of the book competing on internet time lessons from netscape and its battle with microsoft.,705,0.002007493580243284,129,-0.06036506622136414,0.0017671138146399179,0.9669542425555466
meanwhile in the microsoft camp the government s strategy is dismissed as a desperate act taken after a court ruling in june that threatened to undermine the antitrust suit.,619,0.0018771585277334334,95,0.103664016416436,0.0017262976717037552,0.9516399323646699
that ruling came in a separate case involving the interpretation of the consent decree that microsoft signed with the justice department in .,572,0.0017333042033733667,80,0.18832717527776816,0.0016982617307535763,0.9392020476587865
in the june ruling a federal appeals court said that microsoft could bundle its browser with its industry standard windows operating system and call them one product.,749,0.004079014014037891,96,0.03617185446008546,0.0018237509157071636,0.5204259803014563
the appeals court ruling would seem to undercut the assertion in the government s current antitrust case that the browser and the operating system were two separate products bundled together and given away in an effort to thwart competition in the browser market.,634,0.0027283973269933786,141,0.08108409268025273,0.001813493301930046,0.5079569545038605

so it has taken a blunderbuss approach of scrambling to throw everything it can find even evidence the justice department has had for years into the gun barrel and see what hits.,160,0.0009974692081411581,79,0.11348337575526926,0.0016991667092552771,0.9355670179801502

while not seeking to block the release of windows government lawyers wanted to get to the the courtroom as early as possible as pc makers and computer users adopt this latest version of microsoft s windows operating system which functions as the central nervous system for more than percent of personal computers sold.,699,0.0017332813632527095,177,-0.138682810459665,0.0018234671610939312,0.9090810920423565

but the only thing that was wrapped up in a bow in time for the may filing was the browser said one person who worked on the case.,222,0.002193740387244076,41,0.03144223331986723,0.0017411206798342883,0.9125555035576942

what is more one person noted the prosecution team was not at full strength until shortly before the suit was filed.,61,0.00113446389937628,52,0.041872184593094386,0.001716064085960743,0.5821136259202142
david boies a renowned courtroom litigator and a former partner at cravath swaine amp moore who successfully defended ibm in its year confrontation with the government was named as special counsel for the justice department last december.,287,0.0008018252451388637,155,0.056783510439555596,0.0016568598611137754,0.967415785692465
but boies who left cravath last year did not start working full time for the justice department until mid april because he was still finishing private cases for his own firm boies amp schiller.,233,0.0016885346797171645,96,0.09993582468447991,0.001750100120073924,0.6749395997464104
the antitrust suit filed in may leaned heavily on the netscape story mentioning microsoft s main rival in the browser market some times in the complaint and a supporting memorandum.,691,0.002441089982777991,110,-0.025689916123501414,0.001805989994423653,0.4970120090499992
but it also prominently mentioned microsoft s tactics against sun microsystems creator of java an internet programming language and cited it as an example of microsoft s behavior.,778,0.0011417473963282734,106,-0.03799696121751283,0.001573339662206801,0.9533544155854806
it was crafted as a template that could be added to without much stretching one person involved in the case said.,103,0.0013217694973414614,40,0.07009683752008454,0.0016418019567756375,0.9139970080493415
and so as new evidence piled up and seemed to fit into a pattern klein step by step approved the widening of the case the person said.,154,0.001247726875051074,57,0.06331385359236763,0.0016958969774439326,0.663847907811179
