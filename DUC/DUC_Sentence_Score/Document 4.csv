since the owners re opened the current agreement because . percent of revenue was going toward salaries the percent figure would probably have to come down substantially for the owners to agree to such a proposal.,141,0.004389326993606132,89,-0.19361177948438965,0.0026359761451399686,0.9481109114438269

seventeen players including union president patrick ewing and vice presidents mitch richmond herb williams dikemebe mutombo and ty corbin attended the meeting along with stern granik and five members of the ownership committee madison square garden president dave checketts and owners abe pollin of washington gordon gund of cleveland les alexander of houston and jerry colangelo of phoenix.,211,0.0014924710504065127,281,0.04672378112977699,0.002360305646163526,0.984465550116706
the talks featured what the players association implied were a bevy concessions made to the owners that they felt would accommodate the league s desire to swing the revenue pendulum back toward the owners.,129,0.002978733446058137,112,0.04477496635877876,0.002779444036598677,0.9595924837181687

the main sticking point has been the owners insistence on a salary cap without exceptions the implementation of which they believe would bring player salaries in line with revenue growth.,273,0.002913201980877627,98,-0.28919145990353035,0.002719520884139646,0.5171756310056712
while the players did not discuss the elimination of the larry bird exception a clause that allows a player to secure any amount of money he wants in re signing with his current team they did address the exception in their taxation proposal.,320,0.004133157489042623,118,-0.11967117048533935,0.0028162808439401907,0.9616826273912678
the main points were as follows a percent tax would be imposed on salary earned above million a clause that would affect only a few players who exercised their bird rights.,182,0.003777162413775232,77,-0.23749196444257423,0.0027566832946013895,0.9521017277418529

since the owners re opened the current agreement because . percent of revenue was going toward salaries the percent figure would probably have to come down substantially for the owners to agree to such a proposal.,141,0.004389326993606132,89,-0.19361177948438965,0.0026359761451399686,0.9481109114438269
