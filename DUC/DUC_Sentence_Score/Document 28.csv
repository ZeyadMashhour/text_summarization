because of the collapse of the russian economy doubts that russia can produce enough rockets and other equipment to support both projects led russia to promise that it would abandon mir and destroy the station by next summer.,221,0.004291620253089378,116,0.20876030649993146,0.004732373953385017,0.9626636070800298
