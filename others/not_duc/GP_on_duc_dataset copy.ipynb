       "\"\\nA strong sign that this city is going bonkers for the Padres came \\nFriday morning when 680 fans agreed to shave their heads for a radio \\npromotion raffle in return for a 1-in-680 chance at skybox tickets \\nfor post-season play. ``This was more a show of support for the team \\nthan it was for the one ticket,'' said Tommy Sablan, producer of the \\n``Jeff and Jer'' show. ``It was symbolic of the efforts of the bald \\nPadres _ Tony Gwynn, Wally Joyner, Greg Vaughn, Jim Leyritz. About \\na thousand people showed up _ men, women and children. We had 10 barbers \\nand 20 hairdressers and it took six hours for the lines to either \\nget buzzed or straight-razored. ``We were shocked at the turnout. \\nBut this is a bandwagon town. `Buy the ticket on the day of the concert' \\ntype public. You'll see an even bigger bandwagon on Monday when they've \\nwon and then hopefully we play the Yankees and it's a real World Series.'' \\nAfter the Padres beat the Braves, 3-0, in Game 2 of the National League \\nChampionship Series on Thursday night in Atlanta to take a two-game \\nlead in the four-of-seven-game series, San Diego fans began gearing \\nup for a shot at the World Series in more traditional ways. It would \\nbe the team's first World Series appearance since 1984, and in the \\ndowntown business district Friday, marquees and banners read ``Go \\nPadres'' and a lunch-hour rally was attended by several hundred fans. \\nThe Padres set an attendance record of 2,555,901 this season, up a \\nhalf-million from last year and nearly a million and a half from three \\nyears ago. It stemmed in part from an effort by John Moores, the Padres \\nowner, and Larry Lucchino, the team's president, to put family entertainment \\nin the park after they bought the team in December 1994. ``This is \\na more diversified group of fans than I saw in Atlanta,'' Lucchino \\nsaid. ``Their crowd seemed yuppified. We're proud of our three generations \\nof families who come to the games.'' Donna McMahon, a 63-year-old \\nhomemaker from La Jolla, has been a fan since she was 10 and the Pacific \\nCoast League Padres played at Lane Field near the harbor. She would \\ntake a streetcar after school to meet her father, and he would buy \\nbleacher seats. Later, she brought her four children to Jack Murphy \\nStadium for the National League Padres when 2,500 people was a crowd. \\nNow, she brings her grandchildren to a sold-out Qualcomm Stadium. \\n``There are different groups in the stands,'' she said, ``the upper \\nclass, the middle class, the business person, the beer-drinking fan, \\nthe children, all of the Mexican fans from across the border. We are \\ntrue fans _ all of us.'' San Diego Mayor Susan Golding agrees, while \\nalso giving credit to the balmy weather. ``Padre fans are a cross-section \\nfrom all over the county,'' she said. ``Downtown, suburban, rural, \\neast, north, ranchers and farmers to high-tech engineers, yuppies \\nto the new kids _ the X generation. A lot from across the border. \\nThe Padres are extremely popular in Tijuana. We do have the perfect \\nweather for a long baseball season. Playing in the World Series in \\nOctober has got to be better than in New York.'' Carlos Carrion, who \\nwas born in San Diego and has been a baseball fan for 25 years, brings \\nhis 10- and 8-year-old sons to the stadium. ``This is a great chance \\nto let my children see the players work,'' Carrion said. ``They can \\nlook up to these guys and understand their character and their work \\nethic.'' The Padres ticket office estimates that on average, more \\nthan 15,000 fans in the 65,000-seat stadium are Latin Americans from \\nSan Diego, Baja California or the state of Sonora. The Padres have \\nthe first major league baseball souvenir store in Tijuana. \\n \\nThe moment of truth for Chuck Knoblauch came in the bottom of the \\nfirst inning when his name was announced at Yankee Stadium for the \\nfirst time since he neglected to chase down that memorable loose ball \\nlast Wednesday. There were no boos. It was a very warm ovation. They \\nliked him. They really liked him. Knoblauch exhaled. Knoblauch had \\nemphasized before the game that he was concerned about winning and \\nrumbling into the World Series, not about the fans. But it surely \\nmade Knoblauch feel at home when he realized that the fans had forgiven \\nhim. Victories, more than time, had healed the malice toward Knoblauch \\nand he could play second base without earplugs. When the Yankees defeated \\nthe Indians, 9-5, in Game 6 on Tuesday night to advance to their second \\nWorld Series in three years, Knoblauch was easily the most relieved \\nplayer on the field. The awful mistake that he had made in Game 2 \\nwould be forgotten. The Yankees had won the pennant, and Knoblauch \\nwas celebrating as much as anyone. ``To have them act like that toward \\nme was tremendous,'' said Knoblauch, about the response that he received. \\n``It was a great feeling, and it really helped me out.'' Knoblauch \\nwas wearing a cap that declared the Yankees champions of the American \\nLeague in 1998; Champagne dripped off the brim as he spoke. He did \\nnot look up, but continued to talk about how he had learned a lot \\nby being vilified after making a mistake that Little Leaguers are \\nexpected not to make. ``Just to face things and take it like a man \\nand answer all the questions, although they're tough,'' Knoblauch \\nsaid. ``You see what you're made of when you have to bounce back from \\nsomething like that. That's basically what I learned.'' If the Yankees \\nhad lost the ALCS, even some of Knoblauch's teammates had said that \\nhe would be branded as the villain for failing to pursue the ball \\nthat glanced off Travis Fryman's back while he was running outside \\nthe baseline. Knoblauch had argued with the umpire while the go ahead \\nrun scored from first and the Indians won, 4-1. Now Knoblauch can \\nwatch television and read the newspapers again without getting queasy. \\n``That's huge for him,'' David Cone said. ``That's huge for me. I \\nlet them back into the game, and that would have been a tough one \\nif they would have come back and beat us. And Knobbie, I'm sure he's \\nfeeling a lot better now.'' Knoblauch, who had two hits in five at-bats, \\nwas working on his second bottle of Champagne five minutes after reporters \\nwere allowed into the clubhouse. He flashed the sort of smile that \\nhe had not shown too much recently and, now that the Yankees are in \\nthe World Series, Knoblauch should expect to be teased often about \\nhis mistake. ``Maybe if we go all the way, we'll do that,'' Derek \\nJeter said. ``I don't know what I'll say, but I'll think of something \\ngood.'' \\n \\nHours after Darryl Strawberry was released from Columbia Presbyterian \\nMedical Center Friday, he spoke happily about being able to play with \\nhis two young children, joked about eating a small amount of chicken \\nand potatoes and sounded relieved to be at home in Fort Lee, N.J., \\ninstead of in a hospital. ``I'm really feeling good,'' said Strawberry, \\nin a telephone interview. ``It's nice to be home with the kids and \\nto just kick back. That's all that I'm going to do. This feels good.'' \\nStrawberry, who underwent surgery to remove a cancer from his colon \\non Oct. 3, said he will remain in New Jersey for another 10 or 12 \\ndays before returning home to Rancho Mirage, Calif. The 36-year old \\noutfielder, who lost a significant amount of weight from his 215-pound \\nframe, said he does not have enough strength to attend any of the \\nWorld Series games and is content watching his teammates play the \\nPadres on television. ``My heart is with them,'' said Strawberry, \\nwho spoke to several Yankees after they won the American League championship. \\n``I'm just going to relax at home and watch the game. I'm looking \\nforward to it. I may not be there, but it'll feel like I am.'' Paul \\nO'Neill echoed the sentiments of many Yankees by saying, ``Everything \\nwe're going through is game. This is his life. Any time we get some \\ngood news about Darryl it's uplifting. We're all praying for him.'' \\nSince cancerous cells were found in one of the 36 lymph nodes removed \\nfrom his abdomen during the operation, Strawberry said doctors told \\nhim he will need six months of chemotherapy treatment once he returns \\nto California. The 36-year-old outfielder said doctors told him he \\nwill need one treatment of at least one hour a week. ``I was never \\nscared,'' said Strawberry. ``I was more emotional than anything. At \\nthe time of it, I had played for a while with this. I wanted to keep \\nplaying because I knew we were going to get into the World Series.'' \\nAt that point, Strawberry stopped and laughed, probably because the \\nYankees had made it to the World Series as he expected. ``I wanted \\nto be there because that's what you play for,'' said Strawberry. ``I \\ndon't think that I was ever scared. It's something that I wanted to \\ndeal with head on. I talked to Eric Davis about the chemo. He said \\nit's not as bad as some people say.'' Although the discovery of cancer \\nin one lymph node proved that the cancer had spread, Strawberry remained \\noptimistic about his future and said, ``It didn't worry me. I got \\nall the information from the doctors. One out of 36 is good. It wasn't \\nspreading. It didn't run off and get crazy like cancer can.'' When \\nStrawberry was released from the hospital in a wheelchair Friday, \\na few hundred fans who had congregated chanted, ``Darryl, Darryl.'' \\nStrawberry, who struggled not to cry, hugged a few nurses, thanked \\neveryone for supporting him, then rose from the wheelchair and carefully \\nentered a car. ``Wow, I never thought this day would come,'' Strawberry \\nsaid. ``But it has.'' Unlike David Wells, Saturday night's starter \\nin the World Series who predicted the Yankees would throttle the Padres \\nin five games, Strawberry refused to make a prediction about whether \\nhe will soon be getting his third World Series ring. But Strawberry, \\nwho is still hopeful about returning to play in 1999, sounded very \\nconfident in the 1998 Yankees, who are wearing his number 39 on the \\nback of their caps as inspiration. ``They look really good,'' said \\nStrawberry.'' It's not going to be easy, but I think they're ready. \\nThe best thing about making it to the World Series is you know you \\ndon't have to go anywhere else after that. You've made it to that \\npoint and then you go do the best you can do. That's what it's all \\nabout.'' \\n \\nThe New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 17: It is \\nfitting that this most memorable of baseball seasons should conclude \\nwith a World Series that opens Saturday night in Yankee Stadium, the \\naging but still grand cathedral of the sport. Bedecked in bunting \\nand banners, the revered ballpark always elevates the game with its \\naura of history and accomplishment. That makes it the perfect venue \\nfor part of a championship series that will determine whether the \\n1998 Yankees are one of the greatest teams of the modern era, or just \\na talented squad that owned the regular season but folded in the World \\nSeries. New Yorkers are a boisterous, boastful bunch, and the patter \\nof the city this week has been loud and arrogant, or so it must seem \\nto anyone venturing here from San Diego to root for the Padres. The \\nword on the sidewalks and in the subways is that the Padres don't \\nmeasure up against the Yankees. Sure, they have lethal starting pitchers \\nin Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and one of the game's best closers \\nin Trevor Hoffman, not to mention prolific hitters like Tony Gwynn \\nand Greg Vaughn, who is hobbling but still dangerous. But how is that \\na match for the Yankees' World Series starting rotation of David Wells, \\nOrlando Hernandez, David Cone and Andy Pettitte, bullpen flamethrower \\nMariano Rivera, plus the deepest batting order in baseball? Yet the \\ntruth is that Yankees fans are terrified the team will crumple. Baseball \\nfans, even Yankee fans, can spend a lifetime waiting to see a home \\nteam of historic caliber, and this Yankee team will not reach that \\nsanctified status unless it ends its record-setting season by winning \\nthe World Series. The doubts keep creeping up. The team was pitiful \\nat the plate through most of the playoffs. Tino Martinez, the top \\nrun producer, has been in a numbing slump. Bernie Williams, the American \\nLeague batting champ, hit well in the pennant series against the Cleveland \\nIndians, but has seemed distracted by personal matters. Shane Spencer, \\nthe rookie slugging sensation of September, hasn't turned out to be \\nthe new Mr. October. Pettitte has been struggling since August. The \\ncurious thing about this team, which won more games during the regular \\nseason than any team in American League history, is how quiet and \\nunobtrusive it can be. It sports no dominant superstar, no swaggering \\nclubhouse leader, no one who seems to belong in New York. So when \\nthe Yankees start to drift on the field, fans tend to fear the team \\nmight simply fade away. Until the Indians surged temporarily ahead \\nin the playoffs, the Yankees had faced no serious test of resiliency \\nall season. New Yorkers can already taste that ticker-tape parade \\nup Broadway. But behind every mighty cheer at the stadium Saturday \\nnight will lurk the fear that when the curtain falls on the season, \\nan unheralded and unlegendary team from San Diego will be the one \\nthat is remembered. \\n \\nYANKEES Pitching The starting pitching enabled the Yankees to advance \\npast Cleveland in the American League Championship Series. David Wells \\nis 7-1 in his career in the postseason and he should have an additional \\nedge against a Padres' lineup that is generally less effective against \\nleft-handed pitching. Orlando Hernandez has four terrific pitches, \\npitched seven shutout innings in the pivotal Game 4 of the ALCS and \\nearned the start in Game 2 of this series. David Cone should benefit \\nfrom six days' worth of rest when he starts Game 3, as well as being \\nable to pitch in warm Southern California. Mariano Rivera's stuff \\nmight be as good as it has been all year, and Mike Stanton continues \\nto be a dominant postseason pitcher. Reasons for concern: the erratic \\nAndy Pettitte, who needs a home-plate umpire to call strikes on pitches \\nlow and away, and Jeff Nelson, who lost his command in his last brief \\nouting. Offense There were signs in the ALCS that the offense is coming \\nout of its collective slump _ Chuck Knoblauch is getting on base consistently, \\nDerek Jeter is back to driving the ball to right field and through \\nthe middle, Bernie Williams had three hits in Game 6, and Scott Brosius \\nhas been a consistent force at the bottom of the lineup. But the Yankees \\ndo have holes: Chili Davis will be hard-pressed to catch up to the \\nfastballs of Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, and Tino Martinez's postseason \\nfunk is a problem. The Yankees could use a contribution from Jorge \\nPosada, who will start in Games 1 and 2 and may get a chance to drive \\npitches low in the strike zone, where he can hit with power. Defense \\nThe Yankees have the best defense in baseball, excellent up the middle \\nwith Jeter and Knoblauch, and at third with Brosius. Nobody's really \\ntaken advantage of the fact that Williams has a poor arm in center \\nfield, but rest assured that Ken Caminiti, Steve Finley and Greg Vaughn \\nwill try. The Indians did expose the fact that the Yankees' pitchers \\nhave trouble preventing baserunners from stealing from second to third \\nbase. Baserunning The Yankees run well as they take extra bases, particularly \\nPaul O'Neill, Brosius, Jeter and Knoblauch going first-to-third; Williams \\ncan make mistakes. The Yankees probably won't be able to steal against \\nKevin Brown, who has an effective slide step, but they could be aggressive \\nagainst Andy Ashby, or the combination of Sterling Hitchcock and Jim \\nLeyritz. PADRES Hitting Except for Jim Leyritz, no one in the San \\nDiego lineup is particularly hot or particularly frightening at the \\nmoment. Tony Gwynn hasn't been as consistent as he usually is, Ken \\nCaminiti and Greg Vaughn have been streaky. But the Padres are a veteran \\nteam capable of putting the ball in play, getting runners on base \\nand then moving them along, and so long as they are getting exceptional \\npitching, that's all they really need. Quilvio Veras, the leadoff \\nhitter, is adept at drawing walks and Steve Finley, who has become \\nmore pull conscious in the last two years, could try to take aim at \\nthe right field stands in Yankee Stadium. Vaughn's power could be \\na factor if the Yankees' pitchers don't jam him enough to keep him \\nfrom leaning over the plate. Pitching Kevin Brown is the best pitcher \\nin this series, capable of winning three games if necessary, should \\nPadres manager Bruce Bochy choose to start him in Games 1, 4 and 7. \\nBut at some point, San Diego will need a big outing from either Andy \\nAshby or Sterling Hitchcock. When Ashby's right, he's hitting the \\ncorners with his sinking fastball and his slider, and when his command \\nis suspect, he gets pounded. Hitchcock used his split-fingered fastball \\nto great effectiveness against right-handed batters in the first two \\nrounds of the playoffs, but the Yankees' left-handed hitters may cause \\nhim some concern. San Diego's middle relief is the weakest aspect \\nof the team, with Randy Myers and Mark Langston from the left side \\n(the stuff of each has waned). But if a lead can be delivered into \\nthe hands of closer Trevor Hoffman, he'll keep it. Defense They mostly \\ncatch the ball and avoid mistakes, though they are unspectacular. \\nShortstop Chris Gomez and the second baseman Veras are adept at turning \\ndouble plays, and Caminiti won a Gold Glove at third base last year; \\nWally Joyner has good hands at first; the center fielder Steve Finley \\nis extremely quick in tracking down base hits and returning the ball \\nto the infield. Tony Gwynn's range is better toward the right field \\nline, not nearly as good on balls hit in the gaps. The Yankees will \\nbe able to run on the arm of Vaughn in left field. Baserunning Veras \\ncan steal bases (24) this year, and Finley can in a tight spot, as \\nwell. In general, however, the Padres are a slow, plodding team, though \\nCaminiti and Vaughn are good at going first-to-third, and Gwynn won't \\nmake mistakes on the bases. PITCHING TO THE PADRES Quilvio Veras: \\nA switch-hitter who has more power right-handed; should try to pitch \\nhim down-and-in with breaking balls when he's hitting right-handed, \\njam him with fastballs when he's batting left-handed. Steve Finley: \\nA left-handed hitter who likes to pull the ball. Left-handers like \\nDavid Wells can beat him with breaking balls low and outside. Tony \\nGwynn: When he's hot, he's impossible. When he's not hitting well, \\nhe can be anxious early in the count, and he should be fed breaking \\nballs out of the strike zone. Greg Vaughn: Big-time power on anything \\nhigh and over the plate. Because he likes to pull the ball, you must \\npitch him on the outer edge, occasionally jamming him to keep him \\nhonest. Ken Caminiti: More power right-handed, a better hitter left-handed. \\nThese days, he's a good lowball hitter and can be beat by fastballs \\nup in the zone. Wally Joyner: With runners on base, he'll try to jump \\non a fastball early in the count. Is not a strong hitter and can be \\njammed. Chris Gomez: Like Derek Jeter, likes to hit pitches inside \\nout, to right field and through the middle. He can hit with power \\nif you make a mistake with a breaking ball. Ruben Rivera: An impatient \\nhitter who will chase pitches out of the strike zone. Carlos Hernandez: \\nLooks for the first-pitch fastball in the upper half of the strike \\nzone. Can struggle against breaking balls. Jim Leyritz: No apparent \\nholes right now, can hit fastballs in and away. Best bet is to get \\nahead in the count and try to get him to chase breaking balls. PITCHING \\nTO THE YANKEES Chuck Knoblauch: Hard throwers like to jam him with \\nfastballs because he stands on top of the plate, which is why he gets \\nhit so often. Derek Jeter: Sometimes he has a tendency to chase pitches \\nat his feet, but if you don't get the ball in far enough, he can hammer \\nthe ball over the wall in right. Paul O'Neill: The Yankees' best pure \\nhitter, he sometimes will chase fastballs up and away, particularly \\nafter there is one strike. Bernie Williams: A switch-hitter who has \\ntrouble resisting chest-high fastballs. When he lays off them, he \\nis a much better hitter, and he did this in the last game of the Cleveland \\nseries. Chili Davis: Has a great eye and will work a pitcher deep \\ninto a count, but he can be overpowered with fastballs above his belt. \\nCheats some now to get his bat started, making him vulnerable to off-speed \\npitches. Tino Martinez: Nothing seems right at the moment. Is anxious \\nand chases pitches out of the strike zone when he falls behind in \\nthe count, and isn't taking advantage of mistakes when they're made. \\nScott Brosius: A great breaking ball hitter, but he can also drive \\na fastball a long way when he anticipates, as Cleveland's Charles \\nNagy now knows. Jorge Posada: When batting left-handed, he fares very \\npoorly against splitters, curveballs and sliders. Ricky Ledee: Like \\nall young hitters, he has a tendency to expand the strike zone and \\nchase pitches out of the strike zone after falling behind in the count. \\nKevin Brown likely will attack him aggressively. SATURDAY'S PITCHERS \\nKevin Brown: Best sinking fastball in the game (91-93) mph, a four-seam \\nfastball of 95-97 mph to throw high in the strike zone, a slider that \\nbreaks down and away from right-handed batters, and a forkball that \\ndives at 88-89 mph. Holds runners well. David Wells: Aggressive, aggressive, \\naggressive, challenging hitters with fastballs. His curveball can \\nbe exceptional, and his changeup has improved. Throw strikes: Allowed \\nas many home runs (29) as walks (29), but has not allowed a three-run \\nhomer or a grand slam all year. \\n \\nThe last time they were seen on the field at Yankee Stadium, they \\nwere inadvertently influencing the outcome of the game that sent the \\nCleveland Indians home and the Yankees to the World Series. That's \\nnot to say the umpires will mess up in the World Series, but they \\nhave shown they are eminently capable of interfering with the natural \\nprogression of postseason games. All right, so Ted Hendry won't be \\nin the World Series; the umpires' collective bargaining agreement \\nwith the leagues does not allow an umpire to work both a league championship \\nseries and the World Series. Joe Brinkman won't be here either, even \\nthough the agreement does allow for an umpire to work both a division \\nseries and the World Series. The three American League umpires who \\nare on the six-man World Series crew did work in the first round of \\nthe playoffs. One of them, Richie Garcia, will be the crew chief and \\nbehind the plate in Saturday night's opener at Yankee Stadium. Gene \\nBudig, the AL president, Friday called Garcia, a 24-year veteran, \\none of the league's ``most respected umpires.'' But after Saturday \\nnight, Garcia will move to right field Sunday night for Game 2. Now \\nwhy does that combination sound familiar, Richie Garcia and right \\nfield? Ah yes, the last time Garcia worked a post-season series at \\nYankee Stadium, he was the umpire in Game 1 of the league championship \\nseries two years ago when a young fan from New Jersey _ no name, please; \\nhe has been over-glorified enough _ reached over the fence and caught \\nDerek Jeter's fly ball just as Tony Tarasco, Baltimore's right fielder, \\nprepared to catch it. Garcia ruled no interference, that it was a \\nhome run, then said oops after watching a television replay clearly \\nshowing interference. Too late. The call helped the Yankees win the \\nfirst game and set the tone for the series. ``Even though he made \\na mistake, you know you have the best out there,'' a baseball official, \\nspeaking on the condition of anonymity, said. That knowledge comes \\nas small consolation to the Orioles. Budig, too, acknowledged that \\numpires, like players and managers, aren't perfect. ``Major league \\numpires are skilled at what they do, but they are human,'' he said \\nin a telephone interview. ``Day in and day out they do a very good \\njob for Major League Baseball. Rounds one and two have been difficult, \\nbut that happens from time to time.'' The umpires were so human in \\nthe American League playoffs that it happened from time to time to \\ntime to time. The Cleveland Indians suffered the brunt of the fallibility \\nof the umpires. ``We had a highlight reel of umpires getting knocked \\ndown by baseballs,'' general manager John Hart said after the Indians' \\nfinal game against the Yankees. ``The umpires didn't lose the game \\nfor us, but we had our share of controversies in two playoff series \\nwith umpires.'' In the division series against Boston, Brinkman, the \\nplate umpire, was so bad with his calls on pitches and plays at the \\nplate that he immediately provoked disputes that led to his ejecting \\nof Mike Hargrove, the Indians' manager, three pitches into Game 2, \\nand Dwight Gooden, their starting pitcher, 19 pitches later. Hendry \\nwas right or wrong, depending on one's point of view, for his noncall \\nof interference on Travis Fryman in the 12th inning of Game 2 of the \\nALCS. That ruling went in favor of the Indians. Little else did. In \\nGame 4, Jeter was stealing second in the fifth inning when the on-target \\nthrow from Sandy Alomar Jr. hit Jim McKean, who jumped to try to get \\nout of the way but instead kicked the ball into right field. A batted \\nball, Omar Vizquel's line drive, struck Hendry in Game 6. But the \\nworst call of Game 6 was Hendry's on a force play at second base. \\nHendry called Bernie Williams safe, ruling that Vizquel's foot came \\noff the base before he caught the ball. Members of the Yankees indicated \\nFriday that they, too, thought the call was wrong. ``I don't know,'' \\nWilliams said when asked what he thought, ``but I'll take it. It was \\na big play.'' But did he think he was out? ``I'd rather not comment \\nabout that,'' he said. ``It will stir a lot of controversy. I don't \\nwant to get into that.'' When a player believes he was safe, he says \\nso and doesn't worry about any subsequent controversy. If Williams \\nwas implying that he thought he was out, another member of the Yankees \\nsaid he had no doubt that Williams was out. ``I wasn't sure at first,'' \\nthis uniformed member of the team said, ``but when I saw it was Hendry, \\nI said uh-oh. I also thought Omar is so smooth you'd think he wouldn't \\ncome off the bag. Then I saw the replay. He was out.'' The game today \\nis faster than it used to be, this observer said. The umpires have \\nto be sharper. Maybe Garcia, Dale Scott and Tim Tschida from the American \\nLeague, and Jerry Crawford, Dana DeMuth and Mark Hirschbeck from the \\nNational League, will be as sharp as an 18th century French guillotine \\nin these four to seven games. Leonard Coleman, the NL president, said \\nhe thought his umpires were first-rate in the division and league \\nseries and added that he has ``three splendid umpires'' working the \\nWorld Series. Budig said: ``The World Series crew is proven and first-rate. \\nWe have total confidence in them.'' The umpires should let the players \\nmake the errors and the managers the bad decisions. Then everyone \\nwill talk about the players and managers and not the umpires. \\n \\nAs Bernie Williams starts what could be his final series with the \\nYankees in Game 1 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium Saturday night, \\nhe wants to do it with a free mind. Free of worrying about his extremely \\nuncertain future and an undisclosed personal matter that has made \\nthis post-season as perplexing as it has been pleasing. But it is \\nnot easy to keep the mind uncluttered. Williams does not know if he \\nwill sign with the Yankees and return to center field next season, \\nbecause he wants to test free agency. There is a good chance the Yankees \\nwill not offer him the most lavish contract, so Williams might be \\nforced to decide between the fattest paycheck and a new situation \\nin the baseball city of his choice or a pretty fat paycheck and a \\nfamiliar situation in the Bronx. Scott Boras, Williams' agent, compared \\nhis client with players in the $10 million-a-year bracket last season, \\nso that price tag has surely escalated after Williams won the American \\nLeague batting title with a .339 average while drilling 26 homers \\nand knocking in 97 runs. Williams was asked if he agreed with the \\ntheory that other teams will outbid the Yankees. ``I do not know,'' \\nsaid Williams, who has been aloof during this post-season, but has \\ndeclined to discuss why. ``And I'm thinking about this a little more \\nthan I would like to. I would like to keep my focus on the series.'' \\nIt is not an issue Williams or the Yankees wants to study Saturday \\nor in the coming days, because the team is four victories away from \\na championship. Still, it is an issue that hovers over the Yankees \\nas ominously as the owner George Steinbrenner hovers over general \\nmanager Brian Cashman. ``It's a tough thing,'' Cashman said about \\nbalancing the excitement of being in the World Series with the reality \\nof trying to re-sign Williams. ``You know the ugliness of the future \\nis right in front of you.'' Although Williams has been adamant about \\nnot discussing the future, he relented slightly Friday. When a reporter \\nasked him what the reasons would be for staying with the Yankees, \\nWilliams' answer included an escape clause. ``Just the fact that I've \\nbeen here my whole career,'' Williams said. ``That has a lot to do \\nwith it. The relationships that I've come to know during the years, \\nI think it would be very hard, but not impossible, to start from scratch \\nsomewhere else.'' Williams continued: ``But I think the reality of \\nthe game in this day and age is things happen. You can't really write \\nthings in stone that they're going to happen. People get traded. People \\nbecome free agents and go to other teams. I have to make a decision \\nreally thinking about all the people I'm accountable for.'' When Williams \\nwas asked what better situation could a player have than being the \\ncenter fielder for the Yankees, winning a batting crown and being \\nin the World Series, the 30-year-old was stumped. ``Wow, that's pretty \\ngood right there,'' Williams said. ``It's funny you mention that, \\nbecause I really haven't thought about any of that. I think, at some \\npoint in the off season, I was going to sit down and think, wow, it \\nwasn't a bad year at all.'' While Cashman would not discuss financial \\nmatters, another Yankee official said the team will not offer Williams \\nas much as $12 million a year _ unless Steinbrenner gets generous \\nafter a possible championship. It is more likely that the Yanks would \\noffer Williams in the $10 million-a-year range. ``I'd hate to have \\nto speculate on something at this point,'' Cashman said. ``We'll give \\nit our best effort to sign him at a level that we're comfortable with. \\nHopefully, that will be enough. Then we'll have a marriage. If not, \\nwe'll have a divorce.'' While Williams has earned the right to become \\na free agent and pursue the contract he wants in the city he wants, \\nhe has interesting choices to make. When a reporter asked Williams \\nhow he would respond to someone who suggested that he accept less \\nfrom the Yankees to remain in a city where he is popular, where he \\nlikes his teammates and manager, and where the team has been in the \\npost-season for four straight years, he did not hesitate to answer. \\n``My response to that would be it's not the time right now to start \\nthinking about that,'' Williams said. ``If I start thinking about \\nthat, it'll distract me to what I need to do in the World Series.'' \\nWilliams then talked about how the Yankees are at the end of a remarkable \\nseason and how he did not want his situation to disrupt that. But, \\nwith Williams' status uncertain, he was asked if the next four to \\nseven games would be bittersweet, since he could be ending a 13-year \\nassociation with the Yankees. ``I don't want to talk about that,'' \\nWilliams said. ``I'm going to have a lot of fun out there. I'm going \\nto go all out.'' Then Williams walked away from the interview. \\n \\nTalk about high expectations. It's not just the man from Tampa who \\nhas them anymore. Knowing their baseball as well as they do, everybody \\nin the Joe Torre family passed up tickets for the divisional series \\nand the league championship series as just so much parsley on the \\nplate of life. ``The pressure was on to get to the World Series, so \\nI can see all those people,'' Torre, the Yankees' manager, was saying \\nbefore New York went out to play the here-we-are, let's-go-for-it \\nSan Diego Padres in the Stadium Saturday night. Now that the Yankees \\nare in the Series, their Florida-based owner and their fans and they \\nthemselves can see nothing more appropriate than four more victories. \\nAnything less than 125 would feel like emptiness. But why should the \\nYankees be any different from the six teams that already fell off \\nthe bus to this World Series? The gloom and doom in the six other \\ncities will not compare to the letdown that would grip New York and \\nthe owner's insatiable little heart should the Yanks come up short. \\nThe three-tiered playoff system has practically turned baseball into \\nfootball, where the survival-of-the-fittest mentality produces one \\nexalted Super Bowl champion and a league full of chumps and losers, \\ncondemned to a nether world of Parcells-like demons kicking them in \\ntheir sore spots for eternity. The World Series used to be a short \\nand sweet reward for excellence, but that was when there were eight \\nteams per league, and the winners met in daylight in early October. \\nEven if the Yankees clubbed my poor Brooklyn Dodgers into submission \\nonce again, well, there was always next year. But in 1969, baseball \\nbegan league championship series, and in 1995 it began a two-layered \\nplayoff system. The World Series is still different, which is why \\nwe should all resist the babble of ``post-season records'' flung at \\nus by the hyperactive computers and the hyperactive broadcasters from \\nthe dozens of different networks that carry baseball. The World Series \\nis still a competition between one league that encourages pitchers \\nto be athletes and another league relatively devoid of strategy. Somehow \\nthe ``playoffs'' leave just about everybody feeling inadequate. Think \\nabout it. The Houston Astros are going around feeling they cannot \\nperform in the post-season. The Texas Rangers are sulking because \\nthey had the best hitting in the league and could hardly touch Yankee \\npitching when it counted. In Chicago, the glory of winning a special \\nplayoff for the wild-card spot and Sammy Sosa's 66 home runs has been \\npre-empted. The very city that beat the Cubs for the 1969 eastern \\ntitle held a parade for Sosa Saturday in the canyons where Lindbergh \\nand John Glenn and the 1969 Mets were once hailed. Speaking of indignity, \\nthere are the Red Sox, whose occasional qualification for the playoffs \\nis merely a signal that nothing good can come of it. In Atlanta, the \\nteam of the '90s has won exactly one World Series, and now it is up \\nto management to keep repeating that: ``The main goal is to get to \\nthe Series. This is a recorded announcement. This is a recorded announcement. \\nThis is a recorded announcement.'' In Cleveland, the fans had to live \\nwith the phrase ``Nineteen forty-eight!'' being chanted at the Indians \\nin the Bronx as the Yankees put the Indians out of misery. That leaves \\nthe Padres as the only team with virtually nothing to lose. This can \\nbe good, or it can be bad. Bruce Bochy, the manager, a reserve on \\nthe 1984 San Diego World Series team, has said: ``A lot of the players \\non that team said, looking back, we wish we would have had a little \\ndifferent attitude instead of just saying, `Hey, we are in the World \\nSeries.' And this year, I think you will see the players out there \\nplaying to win.'' Torre recalled being the underdog in 1996, but he \\nsaid his Yankees felt they could beat the Braves. ``I am sure that \\nis the way the Padres feel right now, that maybe other people aren't \\npredicting a lot for them, but I am sure they are for themselves,'' \\nTorre said. ``I think getting here is where the pressure is,'' Torre \\nadded. ``You want to win, but getting to the World Series is so tough \\nafter playing 162 games and getting into post-season and then having \\nto fight, bite and scratch and everything else to get here.'' Torre \\ncontinued: ``You don't think about in spring training that we want \\nto go and win the World Series. You want to get to the World Series. \\nThen you get there, well, you have played well enough and won enough \\ngames, then of course, we want to win. ``As far as legitimizing our \\nseason _ I hate to even think in negative terms, but if San Diego \\nhappens to win the World Series, sure it takes a little bit of the \\nluster off what we have accomplished by getting here, but I think \\nthat was our goal, initially.'' The key word in that sentence is ``initially.'' \\nThe Yankees built an insatiable demand for more victories _ and World \\nSeries tickets in the Torre family. While they're at it, the Yankees \\nhad better win the whole thing. They are a victim of their own excellence. \\n \\nA new shipment of bats arrived for Tino Martinez on Friday, and he \\nmassaged the handles to make sure they were thin enough, knocked on \\nthe barrels and listened for a certain sound and swung them slowly \\nagain and again. Martinez was so excited about the fresh bats, he \\nreacted like a Little Leaguer who was wielding an aluminum bat for \\nthe first time. ``You were saving the World Series trees until now, \\nright?'' Martinez said to the representative from the bat company. \\n``These are from World Series trees, aren't they?'' Martinez could \\njoke about the bats being specially designed for the World Series \\nbecause the Yankees began their quest for a second title in the past \\nthree years when they play host to the San Diego Padres in Game 1 \\nat Yankee Stadium Saturday night. Major leaguer players who were watching \\non television could not imitate David Letterman and joke about World \\nSeries wood. Even though Martinez has struggled with numerous bats \\nduring the post-season, he could joke because the Yankees are still \\nalive for the title. Martinez is still alive. For now, Martinez, the \\npower hitter who has mostly been missing in action, could joke around. \\nFor now. ``You always get a fresh start in the post-season because \\nit's game to game,'' said Martinez. ``If you win, you've got another \\ngame the next day so you forget about the bad at-bats. It's easier \\nto do that in post-season because your next at-bat could be the biggest \\nat-bat of the season.'' Normally, having Martinez at the plate for \\nthe biggest at-bat of the season would be a pleasing sight to the \\nYankees. But not when the calendar flips to October. Martinez has \\nexperienced another frustrating post-season. He is 5 for 30 with 10 \\nstrikeouts, no homers and only 1 run batted in for a hitting-starved \\nteam that has batted .229 while still winning 7 of 9 post-season games \\nbecause of superior pitching. Can the Yankees continue to win if Martinez, \\ntheir most valuable run producer, is a sometime singles hitter? ``We've \\njust gotten through two good series,'' said Paul O'Neill. ``The Yankees \\nwon those series. You don't focus on one guy. You focus on winning. \\nThe whole team won.'' As much as Joe Torre talked about Martinez needing \\none line-drive hit to get him in a groove, the 30-year-old first baseman \\nis in a career drought in the post-season. Since joining the Yankees, \\nMartinez is 20 for 107 (.187) with one homer and 4 RBI in 29 post-season \\ngames. Those are puny statistics, especially for a player who has \\ndriven in 381 runs in 455 regular season games over the last three \\nyears. ``I would guess that Tino would have a great series,'' O'Neill \\nsaid. ``Baseball has a way of evening things out. You have a bad series, \\nyou come back and have a great series. In the season, that's easier \\nto do. In the post-season, it gets tougher.'' It cannot get much tougher \\nfor Martinez, who was dropped from fifth to sixth in the order during \\nthe American League Championship Series against the Cleveland Indians \\nand will remain in that spot until further notice. Martinez has blamed \\nhis paucity of production on impatience and on trying to do too much. \\nHe has sometimes flailed at poor pitches during hitter's counts of \\n3-1 and 2-0, instead of working the count, and he has admitted that \\nhis previous failures in the post-season have caused him to pursue \\nthe obviously unattainable five-run homer. Actually, Martinez has \\nalready made some alterations, and he has reached base 7 times in \\nhis last 10 plates appearances on a double, a single, a hit-by-pitch \\nand 4 walks. It is not enough to pacify George Steinbrenner, but it \\nis something for him to cling to. Until last night, anyway, when Martinez \\nhad to face Kevin Brown, a nasty right-hander who had retired him \\nin 30 of 34 career at-bats. ``If I was getting good pitches and missing \\nthem, then I'd say I have a bad swing working,'' said Martinez. ``But \\nI've been swinging at bad pitches. Right now, I've just got to be \\npatient and wait.'' The Yankees will wait with him. They have to. \\nIn the 1996 World Series, Torre started Cecil Fielder over Martinez \\nat first in Games 3, 4 and 5. It was a difficult decision because \\nMartinez had paced the team in RBI while Fielder did not join the \\nYankees until July 31. But the Yankees grabbed all three games so \\nit worked. Torre does not have such an attractive replacement this \\nseason in Luis Sojo. So the Yankees will stay with Martinez, for better \\nor worse, while he tries to stay positive and finally produce. ``It's \\nthe World Series,'' said Martinez. ``You got to go out there and have \\nfun with it. Big games are all big games. You want to go out there \\nand enjoy that game and try to do your best to win that game. You \\ndon't think that you might lose that day.'' \\n \\nChuck Knoblauch and Tino Martinez were as popular as squeegee men \\na week ago, the speculation rampant that one or the other or both \\nmight be exiled if the Yankees' historic year crumbled in the post-season. \\nTwo big hits in the midst of a big inning changed all that Saturday \\nnight in Game 1 of the World Series. The Yankees trailed San Diego, \\n5-2, in the seventh inning, but Knoblauch hit a three-run home run \\nto tie the score, and five batters later, Martinez smashed a grand \\nslam. The seven-run explosion rocketed the Yankees to a 9-6 victory \\nin the opener of the four-of-seven-game series, before 56,712 at Yankee \\nStadium. Orlando Hernandez will pitch against Andy Ashby in Game 2 \\nSunday night at the Stadium. Beyond seizing the advantage in the series, \\nthe Yankees were able to neutralize the Padres' ace, Kevin Brown, \\ndriving him from the mound in the seventh. Brown, seen by many as \\nSan Diego's best hope for a World Series upset, will not pitch again \\nuntil Game 4, at the earliest. Brown was pitching with a three-run \\nlead after the top of the fifth, when Tony Gwynn and Greg Vaughn banged \\nback-to-back homers. One out into the seventh, however, Jorge Posada \\nhit a single, and Brown walked Ricky Ledee. Brown, who had thrown \\na whopping 64 pitches in the first three innings, went out, and the \\nreliever Donne Wall came in to face Knoblauch. This is what the Yankees \\nhave done all season, force a starter from the game in the middle \\ninnings, before exploiting a middle reliever. Knoblauch, of course, \\nhad earned notoriety for his gaffe in the Game 2 of the American League \\nChampionship Series against Cleveland, standing and waiting for an \\ninterference call as the ball rolled to a stop behind him and the \\ndecisive run scored. The Yankees came back to win the series, however; \\nKnoblauch got a reprieve and talked about how much the experience \\nhad helped him. Facing Wall with a one-ball, no-strike count, Knoblauch \\nhad to duck under a runaway fastball. Two balls, no strikes. Wall \\nhad to throw a strike, Knoblauch swung hard and lifted a high fly \\ndown the left-field line. Off the bat, it did not look like much. \\nBut it kept carrying, Vaughn drifting back in left and looking up, \\nto see the ball disappear into the stands. Tie game. Yankee Stadium \\nshook. Knoblauch rounded the bases, crossed home plate and thrust \\nboth arms into the air, yelling to the crowd, like a hyped Olympic \\nweightlifter who had just successfully hoisted a half-ton. He stomped \\naround the dugout, his helmet on, teammates banging on him happily. \\nWhen Derek Jeter singled, nobody really noticed. Wall left the game, \\nand Mark Langston took over. Paul O'Neill flied out, and after Jeter \\nadvanced on a wild pitch, Bernie Williams was intentionally walked. \\nChili Davis drew a walk. Bases loaded, once more, with Martinez coming \\nto the plate, with exactly one run batted in in his first 76 career \\nat-bats in league championship and World Series games. With the count \\ntwo balls and two strikes, Langston threw a pitch near the outside \\ncorner that he thought should have been a strike. Instead, Garcia \\ncalled it a ball. Langston glared, snapping at the return throw. Langston \\nand Martinez and everyone on the field now understood that with the \\nbases loaded and a 3-2 count, Langston would have to throw what players \\nrefer to as a cookie _ a tasty pitch over the middle. Martinez ate \\nup this cookie. The ball soared into the upper deck in right field, \\nlifting three years of post-season misery off the back of the Yankees' \\nfirst baseman, a grand slam. The crowd called out Martinez from the \\ndugout again. Like Knoblauch, Martinez pumped both arms, and later \\nthe crowd would chant his name, and Martinez would wave his cap. San \\nDiego's lead was long gone. The Yankees had taken a 2-0 lead over \\nBrown in the second inning, forcing him to throw 32 pitches in the \\nsecond. They loaded the bases with a single and two walks, and Ledee, \\nthe rookie left fielder who is playing because none of Torre's left \\nfielders have been hitting, pulled a sinking fastball down the right \\nfield line with two outs. The fans along the foul line stood, some \\nwaving to push the ball fair with the body English, and the ball landed \\non the line, skipping off the wall as two runners scored. The Yankees \\nhad the early edge, they had jumped on Brown, and they had their best \\npitcher on the mound. San Diego's Chris Gomez led off the second inning \\nwith a blooper over shortstop, the ball falling in for a single. Quilvio \\nVeras flied to right, Gwynn grounded out and Gomez took second, bringing \\nVaughn to the plate. David Wells got ahead in the count, no balls \\nand two strikes, with a change-up and a fastball, before trying to \\nrun a fastball inside on Vaughn, who hit 50 home runs during the regular \\nseason. Vaughn attacked the pitch: a line drive that landed in the \\nsecond deck, foul all the way, but a frightening mistake. Jorge Posada, \\nthe Yankees' catcher, jogged to the mound to re-think the strategy, \\nperhaps to remind Wells of the conventional wisdom: you must pitch \\nVaughn on the outer edge of the plate. Posada returned to the plate, \\ncalled for an outside fastball, Wells threw. Vaughn's swing was short \\nand quick, the ball making a click sound off the bat, like a well-struck \\ngolf ball, before carrying over the wall in right-center field. Tie \\ngame. Wells retired the first two batters in the fifth inning, before \\njamming Veras with an inside fastball. Veras' bat snapped on contact, \\nbut it was enough to send a looper into short center field, a single. \\nGwynn stepped in, having hit a single in his first two at-bats, and \\nlooked for a sign from the third base coach Tim Flannery. With a runner \\non first, he likes to try to pull a ball through the right side of \\nthe infield. Wells fired a fastball, Gwynn turned on the pitch and \\nripped it, a line drive that crashed off the facing of the upper deck \\nin right field. The Padres jumped from the dugout, celebrating, as \\nWells turned away, disgusted, asking for a new baseball. He got one, \\ndelivered another fastball, and Vaughn slugged this deep into the \\nleft field stands. Two pitches, two home runs, the first back-to-back \\nhome runs allowed by Wells since April 30. San Diego led, 5-2, and \\nYankee Stadium was silent. It would not stay that way. \\n\""
