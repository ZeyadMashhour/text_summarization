"Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed.Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in 
July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form 
a government on its own.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party.``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability 
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised 
speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.Hun 
Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national 
election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government 
on its own.Hun Sen said his current government would remain in 
power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one.Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest 
opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating 
inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence 
in Beijing.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees.The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, 
but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and 
recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. 
Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding 
resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives 
calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian 
law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution 
include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against 
anti-government demonstrations.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation.The ruling party supported the police action 
in its statement, noting that public property was damaged by protesters 
and that grenades were thrown at Hun Sen's home after Sam Rainsy suggested 
in a speech that the U.S. government should fire cruise missiles at 
Hun Sen.``The leaders of illegal demonstrations 
are the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving 
from the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly 
violence as ``minor incidents.''Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government.In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.``The major political 
crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock 
facing the nation has also come to an end,'' the king said in his 
statement.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Monday, Sam 
Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament.Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country.The assurances 
were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun 
Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices 
in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind 
a plot against his life.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied 
to all politicians.``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members 
of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' 
the opposition leader said in a statement.Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties.

against the old government Monday in a letter to ADB President Mitsuo 
Sato calling for the bank to stop lending money to it.``We respectfully 
advise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loans to 
the current regime in Cambodia,'' the two party leaders wrote.After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen

Friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun

long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The agreement 
came surprisingly quickly following Ranariddh's return Thursday from 
Thailand, where he had been holed up with other opposition figures 
for weeks amid fears for their safety if they stayed in Cambodia. 
The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.It could also hasten Cambodia's entry 
into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, put on hold last 
year after Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody 
coup.Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Monday, Sam 
Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament.Sam Rainsy said he had been told by Ranariddh that 
his party and former Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been implicated by 
Hun Sen in a rocket attack on the Sept. 24 opening of parliament.

of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they

statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election.The alleged assassination attempt came during massive street demonstrations 
organized by the opposition after Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party 
narrowly won the election.Fearing 
for their safety, Sam Rainsy and his then-ally Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
led an exodus of opposition lawmakers out of Cambodia after parliament 
was ceremonially opened in late September.The platform is said to emphasize administrative, economic 
and judicial reforms, but Sok An would not reveal details, saying 
Hun Sen would announce it when he presents his Cabinet choices to 
the National Assembly.

power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
``We respectfully 
advise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loans to 
the current regime in Cambodia,'' the two party leaders wrote.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation.The ruling party also reminded the 
United States that Washington supported a Cambodian exile government 
dominated by the brutal Khmer Rouge in the 1980s.Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Cambodia's bickering political parties broke a three-month deadlock 
Friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun 
Sen as sole prime minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced.In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party 
dropped insistence on a joint assembly chairmanship shared by Ranariddh 
and party boss Chea Sim, the current speaker.Instead, Sihanouk announced, 
the constitution will be modified to create a new Senate, which Chea 
Sim will head.The Senate will initially be appointed by the king.The parties will hammer out details later.Pok Than, 
one of Ranariddh's negotiators, said the Senate would serve a mostly 
advisory role to the assembly.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The two parties 
said that the assembly would convene again Nov. 25.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.Former battlefield enemies, the CPP and FUNCINPEC have been 
at loggerheads since the CPP narrowly won parliamentary elections 
in July.The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to form a government alone.His 15 seats in the 122-seat assembly are irrelevant 
to forming a working government. 
 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.Ranariddh said Saturday 
that the two parties agreed to keep the ministries of interior and 
defense under co-ministers.The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate.His assurances come a week before the first session 
of Cambodia's new parliament, the National Assembly.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.The deal assures 
the two-thirds vote in parliament needed to approve a new government. 
The men served as co-prime ministers until Hun Sen overthrew Ranariddh 
in a coup last year.Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The 
agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president 
of the National Assembly.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's 
top two political parties _ previously bitter rivals _ to form a coalition 
government led by strongman Hun Sen.``The protocol on cooperation between the CPP and FUNCINPEC will certainly 
bring peace and progress to our nation and people,'' Sihanouk wrote. 
Uncompromising enemies just a few months ago, Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC 
President Prince Norodom Ranariddh agreed Nov. 13 to form a government 
at a summit convened by Sihanouk.The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.The remaining senators, 
he said, should be selected by a method agreed upon by the new government 
and the National Assembly.Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties. 
","Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed.``I would like to make 
it clear that all meetings related to Cambodian affairs must be conducted 
in the Kingdom of Cambodia,'' Hun Sen told reporters after a Cabinet 
meeting on Friday.Hun Sen said 
on Friday that the opposition concerns over their safety in the country 
was ``just an excuse for them to stay abroad.''The Sam Rainsy Party, in a 
statement released Friday, accused Hun Sen of being ``unwilling to 
make any compromise'' on negotiations to break the deadlock.``A meeting 
outside Cambodia, as suggested by the opposition, could place all 
parties on more equal footing,'' said the statement.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.Cambodian leader 
Hun Sen's ruling party and the two-party opposition had called on 
the monarch to lead top-level talks, but disagreed on its location. 
``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party.``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability 
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised 
speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.Hun Sen said his current government would remain in 
power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one.Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest 
opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating 
inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence 
in Beijing.Hun Sen has rejected the opposition's reservations, saying 
it would be inappropriate to hold a summit outside the country.``If those results are strictly respected, there seems no 
reason to hold another summit,'' Hun Sen said in a speech on the anniversary 
of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.``At 
best the current regime could be considered a caretaker government 
as it has not been approved by the National Assembly.''After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees.The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, 
but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and 
recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. 
Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.Ranariddh and his core supporters 
did not return to Cambodia until a few months before an election in 
July this year that the ruling party narrowly won.The ruling party supported the police action 
in its statement, noting that public property was damaged by protesters 
and that grenades were thrown at Hun Sen's home after Sam Rainsy suggested 
in a speech that the U.S. government should fire cruise missiles at 
Hun Sen.Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government.``The major political 
crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock 
facing the nation has also come to an end,'' the king said in his 
statement.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.It could also hasten Cambodia's entry 
into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, put on hold last 
year after Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody 
coup.Earlier, as both sides arrived at the Royal Palace for a second 
day of meetings, Sihanouk said they had agreed in principle to form 
a coalition and made ``important concessions.''After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Monday, Sam 
Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament.Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country.The assurances 
were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun 
Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices 
in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind 
a plot against his life.But a deal 
reached between Hun Sen and his chief rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, 
on forming a new government last week has opened the door for their 
return.``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members 
of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' 
the opposition leader said in a statement.Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government.Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.Hun 
Sen announced a government guarantee Wednesday of all politicians' 
safety and their right to conduct political activities ``in accordance 
with the laws in force.''Sam Rainsy, who earlier called Hun Sen's 
statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election.Sok An, representing 
Hun Sen's party, said Friday that one working group had completed 
its work on a joint political platform to be implemented by the new 
government.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.Sihanouk, recalling 
procedures used in a past government, suggested Tuesday that he should

and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Monday, Sam 
Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament.Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country.The assurances 
were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun 
Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices 
in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind 
a plot against his life.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied 
to all politicians.``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members 
of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' 
the opposition leader said in a statement.Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.Sam Rainsy, who earlier called Hun Sen's 
statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties. 
","Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed.Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in 
July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form 
a government on its own.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party.``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability 
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised 
speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.Hun 
Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national 
election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government 
on its own.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
``We respectfully 
advise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loans to 
the current regime in Cambodia,'' the two party leaders wrote.After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees.Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding 
resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives 
calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian 
law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution 
include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against 
anti-government demonstrations.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.It defended Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh 
as a proper response to the prince's attempts at the time to negotiate 
the defections of senior Khmer Rouge rebels.The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation.``The leaders of illegal demonstrations 
are the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving 
from the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly 
violence as ``minor incidents.''The ruling party also reminded the 
United States that Washington supported a Cambodian exile government 
dominated by the brutal Khmer Rouge in the 1980s.Cambodia's leading opposition party ruled out sharing the presidency 
of Parliament with its arch foe Saturday, insisting it alone must 
occupy the top position in the legislative body.Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government.In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.``The major political 
crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock 
facing the nation has also come to an end,'' the king said in his 
statement.Pok Than, 
one of Ranariddh's negotiators, said the Senate would serve a mostly 
advisory role to the assembly.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to form a government alone.His 15 seats in the 122-seat assembly are irrelevant 
to forming a working government. 
 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate.Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to

and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The

he said, should be selected by a method agreed upon by the new government 
and the National Assembly.Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties.

opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating 
inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence 
in Beijing.At least four demonstrators were killed by police, 
but the discovery of more than 20 bodies in the aftermath has prompted 
speculation that the death tally could be much higher.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy renewed their international lobbying campaign 
against the old government Monday in a letter to ADB President Mitsuo 
Sato calling for the bank to stop lending money to it.``We respectfully 
advise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loans to 
the current regime in Cambodia,'' the two party leaders wrote.After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen

between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Monday, Sam 
Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament.Sam Rainsy said he had been told by Ranariddh that 
his party and former Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been implicated by 
Hun Sen in a rocket attack on the Sept. 24 opening of parliament.

of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they

of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties. 
","Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed.Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in 
July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form 
a government on its own.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party.``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability 
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised 
speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.Hun 
Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national 
election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government 
on its own.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
``We respectfully 
advise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loans to 
the current regime in Cambodia,'' the two party leaders wrote.Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding 
resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives 
calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian 
law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution 
include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against 
anti-government demonstrations.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation.``The leaders of illegal demonstrations 
are the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving 
from the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly 
violence as ``minor incidents.''Cambodia's leading opposition party ruled out sharing the presidency 
of Parliament with its arch foe Saturday, insisting it alone must 
occupy the top position in the legislative body.Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government.Cambodia's bickering political parties broke a three-month deadlock 
Friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun 
Sen as sole prime minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced.In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.It could also hasten Cambodia's entry 
into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, put on hold last 
year after Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody 
coup.The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to form a government alone.Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.The deal assures 
the two-thirds vote in parliament needed to approve a new government. 
Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.The alleged assassination attempt came during massive street demonstrations 
organized by the opposition after Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party 
narrowly won the election.Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The 
agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president 
of the National Assembly.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.The platform is said to emphasize administrative, economic 
and judicial reforms, but Sok An would not reveal details, saying 
Hun Sen would announce it when he presents his Cabinet choices to 
the National Assembly. 
 
King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's 
top two political parties _ previously bitter rivals _ to form a coalition 
government led by strongman Hun Sen.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
Uncompromising enemies just a few months ago, Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC 
President Prince Norodom Ranariddh agreed Nov. 13 to form a government 
at a summit convened by Sihanouk.The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President

figures after two alleged attempts on his life, said they could not 
negotiate freely in Cambodia and called for talks at Sihanouk's residence 
in Beijing.``I would like to make 
it clear that all meetings related to Cambodian affairs must be conducted 
in the Kingdom of Cambodia,'' Hun Sen told reporters after a Cabinet 
meeting on Friday.They have demanded a thorough investigation into their election 
complaints as a precondition for their cooperation in getting the 
national assembly moving and a new government formed.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's

speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.Opposition parties led by Ranariddh and former finance 
minister Sam Ram Rainsy have refused to enter into a coalition with 
Hun Sen until their allegations of election fraud have been thoroughly 
investigated.Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest 
opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating 
inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence 
in Beijing.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman

party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition

the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy renewed their international lobbying campaign 
against the old government Monday in a letter to ADB President Mitsuo 
Sato calling for the bank to stop lending money to it.After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees.The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, 
but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and 
recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. 
Diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled talks appeared to bear fruit 
Monday as Japanese Foreign Affairs Secretary of State Nobutaka Machimura 
said King Norodom Sihanouk has called on Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
to return to Cambodia.Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is

came surprisingly quickly following Ranariddh's return Thursday from 
Thailand, where he had been holed up with other opposition figures 
for weeks amid fears for their safety if they stayed in Cambodia. 
The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which

Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament.Sam Rainsy said he had been told by Ranariddh that 
his party and former Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been implicated by 
Hun Sen in a rocket attack on the Sept. 24 opening of parliament. 
Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country.The assurances 
were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun 
Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices 
in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind 
a plot against his life.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied 
to all politicians.Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to

statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election.Fearing 
for their safety, Sam Rainsy and his then-ally Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
led an exodus of opposition lawmakers out of Cambodia after parliament 
was ceremonially opened in late September.The platform is said to emphasize administrative, economic

advise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loans to 
the current regime in Cambodia,'' the two party leaders wrote.``At 
best the current regime could be considered a caretaker government 
as it has not been approved by the National Assembly.''``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation.The ruling party also reminded the 
United States that Washington supported a Cambodian exile government 
dominated by the brutal Khmer Rouge in the 1980s.Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Cambodia's bickering political parties broke a three-month deadlock 
Friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun 
Sen as sole prime minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced.In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.Instead, Sihanouk announced, 
the constitution will be modified to create a new Senate, which Chea 
Sim will head.The Senate will initially be appointed by the king.The parties will hammer out details later.Pok Than, 
one of Ranariddh's negotiators, said the Senate would serve a mostly 
advisory role to the assembly.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The two parties 
said that the assembly would convene again Nov. 25.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to form a government alone.His 15 seats in the 122-seat assembly are irrelevant 
to forming a working government. 
 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.Ranariddh said Saturday 
that the two parties agreed to keep the ministries of interior and 
defense under co-ministers.The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate.His assurances come a week before the first session 
of Cambodia's new parliament, the National Assembly.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.The deal assures 
the two-thirds vote in parliament needed to approve a new government. 
The men served as co-prime ministers until Hun Sen overthrew Ranariddh 
in a coup last year.Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The 
agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president 
of the National Assembly.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's 
top two political parties _ previously bitter rivals _ to form a coalition 
government led by strongman Hun Sen.``The protocol on cooperation between the CPP and FUNCINPEC will certainly 
bring peace and progress to our nation and people,'' Sihanouk wrote. 
The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.The remaining senators, 
he said, should be selected by a method agreed upon by the new government 
and the National Assembly.Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties. 
","Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed.Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in 
July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form 
a government on its own.The Sam Rainsy Party, in a 
statement released Friday, accused Hun Sen of being ``unwilling to 
make any compromise'' on negotiations to break the deadlock.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.Cambodian leader 
Hun Sen's ruling party and the two-party opposition had called on 
the monarch to lead top-level talks, but disagreed on its location. 
``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party.Hun 
Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national 
election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government 
on its own.Hun Sen said his current government would remain in 
power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government.

between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen

the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees.The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding 
resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives 
calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian 
law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution 
include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against 
anti-government demonstrations.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely

Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament.Sam Rainsy said he had been told by Ranariddh that 
his party and former Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been implicated by 
Hun Sen in a rocket attack on the Sept. 24 opening of parliament. 
Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country.The assurances 
were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun 
Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices 
in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind 
a plot against his life.Sam Rainsy and the 14 members of parliament 
from his party have been holed up overseas for two months.But a deal 
reached between Hun Sen and his chief rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, 
on forming a new government last week has opened the door for their 
return.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied 
to all politicians.``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members 
of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' 
the opposition leader said in a statement.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.Sam Rainsy, who earlier called Hun Sen's 
statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election.The 
agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president

the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties. 
","Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed.Opposition leaders Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition 
figures after two alleged attempts on his life, said they could not 
negotiate freely in Cambodia and called for talks at Sihanouk's residence 
in Beijing.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party.``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability 
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised 
speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest 
opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating 
inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence 
in Beijing.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy renewed their international lobbying campaign 
against the old government Monday in a letter to ADB President Mitsuo 
Sato calling for the bank to stop lending money to it.After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees.The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, 
but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and 
recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. 
Diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled talks appeared to bear fruit 
Monday as Japanese Foreign Affairs Secretary of State Nobutaka Machimura 
said King Norodom Sihanouk has called on Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
to return to Cambodia.Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding 
resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives 
calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian 
law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution 
include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against 
anti-government demonstrations.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.It defended Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh 
as a proper response to the prince's attempts at the time to negotiate 
the defections of senior Khmer Rouge rebels.The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation.The ruling party supported the police action 
in its statement, noting that public property was damaged by protesters 
and that grenades were thrown at Hun Sen's home after Sam Rainsy suggested 
in a speech that the U.S. government should fire cruise missiles at 
Hun Sen.``The leaders of illegal demonstrations 
are the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving 
from the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly 
violence as ``minor incidents.''Cambodia's leading opposition party ruled out sharing the presidency 
of Parliament with its arch foe Saturday, insisting it alone must 
occupy the top position in the legislative body.Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government.In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.``The major political 
crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock 
facing the nation has also come to an end,'' the king said in his 
statement.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Monday, Sam 
Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament.Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country.The assurances 
were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun 
Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices 
in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind 
a plot against his life.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied 
to all politicians.``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members 
of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' 
the opposition leader said in a statement.Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning

statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.In a short letter sent to news

parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party.``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability 
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised 
speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.Hun 
Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national 
election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government 
on its own.Hun Sen said his current government would remain in 
power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one.Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest 
opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating 
inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence 
in Beijing.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees.The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, 
but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and 
recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. 
Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding 
resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives 
calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian 
law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution 
include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against 
anti-government demonstrations.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.It defended Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh 
as a proper response to the prince's attempts at the time to negotiate 
the defections of senior Khmer Rouge rebels.The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation.``The leaders of illegal demonstrations 
are the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving 
from the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly 
violence as ``minor incidents.''Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government.In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.``The major political 
crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock 
facing the nation has also come to an end,'' the king said in his 
statement.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to form a government alone.Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate.Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country.``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members 
of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' 
the opposition leader said in a statement.Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The 
agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president 
of the National Assembly.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.The remaining senators, 
he said, should be selected by a method agreed upon by the new government 
and the National Assembly.Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties. 
","Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed.Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in 
July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form

on Friday that the opposition concerns over their safety in the country 
was ``just an excuse for them to stay abroad.''The Sam Rainsy Party, in a

Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament.Sam Rainsy said he had been told by Ranariddh that 
his party and former Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been implicated by 
Hun Sen in a rocket attack on the Sept. 24 opening of parliament. 
Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country.The assurances 
were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun 
Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices 
in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind 
a plot against his life.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied 
to all politicians.``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members

statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election.The two parties have formed three working

Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.The parties are to form working groups this week

agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president 
of the National Assembly.The two parties have formed three working

of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.The platform is said to emphasize administrative, economic 
and judicial reforms, but Sok An would not reveal details, saying 
Hun Sen would announce it when he presents his Cabinet choices to 
the National Assembly. 
 
King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's 
top two political parties _ previously bitter rivals _ to form a coalition 
government led by strongman Hun Sen.In a short letter sent to news

signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
Uncompromising enemies just a few months ago, Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC 
President Prince Norodom Ranariddh agreed Nov. 13 to form a government 
at a summit convened by Sihanouk.The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended

in its statement, noting that public property was damaged by protesters 
and that grenades were thrown at Hun Sen's home after Sam Rainsy suggested 
in a speech that the U.S. government should fire cruise missiles at 
Hun Sen.``The leaders of illegal demonstrations 
are the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving 
from the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly 
violence as ``minor incidents.''Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government.Cambodia's bickering political parties broke a three-month deadlock 
Friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun 
Sen as sole prime minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced.In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.``The major political 
crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock 
facing the nation has also come to an end,'' the king said in his 
statement.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied 
to all politicians.``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members 
of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' 
the opposition leader said in a statement.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The 
agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president 
of the National Assembly.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's 
top two political parties _ previously bitter rivals _ to form a coalition 
government led by strongman Hun Sen.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties. 
","Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed.Opposition leaders Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition 
figures after two alleged attempts on his life, said they could not 
negotiate freely in Cambodia and called for talks at Sihanouk's residence 
in Beijing.Hun Sen said 
on Friday that the opposition concerns over their safety in the country 
was ``just an excuse for them to stay abroad.''The Sam Rainsy Party, in a 
statement released Friday, accused Hun Sen of being ``unwilling to 
make any compromise'' on negotiations to break the deadlock.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Opposition parties led by Ranariddh and former finance 
minister Sam Ram Rainsy have refused to enter into a coalition with 
Hun Sen until their allegations of election fraud have been thoroughly 
investigated.Hun Sen said his current government would remain in 
power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one.Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest 
opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating 
inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence 
in Beijing.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees.The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, 
but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and 
recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. 
Diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled talks appeared to bear fruit 
Monday as Japanese Foreign Affairs Secretary of State Nobutaka Machimura 
said King Norodom Sihanouk has called on Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
to return to Cambodia.Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding 
resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives 
calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian 
law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution 
include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against 
anti-government demonstrations.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation.The ruling party supported the police action 
in its statement, noting that public property was damaged by protesters 
and that grenades were thrown at Hun Sen's home after Sam Rainsy suggested

president of the National Assembly.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Monday, Sam 
Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament.Sam Rainsy said he had been told by Ranariddh that 
his party and former Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been implicated by 
Hun Sen in a rocket attack on the Sept. 24 opening of parliament. 
Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country.The assurances 
were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun 
Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices 
in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind 
a plot against his life.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied

that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns

statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.In a short letter sent to news

between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied 
to all politicians.``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members 
of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' 
the opposition leader said in a statement.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The 
agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president 
of the National Assembly.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties. 
","Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed.Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in 
July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form 
a government on its own.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party.``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability 
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised 
speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.Hun 
Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national 
election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government 
on its own.Hun Sen said his current government would remain in 
power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one.Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest 
opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating 
inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence 
in Beijing.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees.The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, 
but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and 
recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. 
Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding 
resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives 
calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian 
law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution 
include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against 
anti-government demonstrations.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.It defended Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh 
as a proper response to the prince's attempts at the time to negotiate 
the defections of senior Khmer Rouge rebels.The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation.``The leaders of illegal demonstrations 
are the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving 
from the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly 
violence as ``minor incidents.''Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government.In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.``The major political 
crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock 
facing the nation has also come to an end,'' the king said in his 
statement.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to form a government alone.Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership

of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties. 
","Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed.Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in 
July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form 
a government on its own.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party.``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability 
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised 
speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.Hun 
Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national 
election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government 
on its own.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
``We respectfully 
advise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loans to 
the current regime in Cambodia,'' the two party leaders wrote.After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees.The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, 
but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and 
recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. 
Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding 
resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives 
calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian 
law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution 
include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against 
anti-government demonstrations.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.It defended Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh 
as a proper response to the prince's attempts at the time to negotiate 
the defections of senior Khmer Rouge rebels.The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation.The ruling party supported the police action 
in its statement, noting that public property was damaged by protesters 
and that grenades were thrown at Hun Sen's home after Sam Rainsy suggested 
in a speech that the U.S. government should fire cruise missiles at 
Hun Sen.``The leaders of illegal demonstrations 
are the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving 
from the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly 
violence as ``minor incidents.''The ruling party also reminded the 
United States that Washington supported a Cambodian exile government 
dominated by the brutal Khmer Rouge in the 1980s.Cambodia's leading opposition party ruled out sharing the presidency 
of Parliament with its arch foe Saturday, insisting it alone must 
occupy the top position in the legislative body.Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government.In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.``The major political 
crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock 
facing the nation has also come to an end,'' the king said in his 
statement.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to form a government alone.Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate.Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation
