Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Friday rejected opposition parties' demands 
for talks outside the country, accusing them of trying to ``internationalize'' 
the political crisis. Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed. Opposition leaders Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition 
figures after two alleged attempts on his life, said they could not 
negotiate freely in Cambodia and called for talks at Sihanouk's residence 
in Beijing. Hun Sen, however, rejected that. ``I would like to make 
it clear that all meetings related to Cambodian affairs must be conducted 
in the Kingdom of Cambodia,'' Hun Sen told reporters after a Cabinet 
meeting on Friday. ``No-one should internationalize Cambodian affairs. 
It is detrimental to the sovereignty of Cambodia,'' he said. Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in 
July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form 
a government on its own. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have charged that 
Hun Sen's victory in the elections was achieved through widespread 
fraud. They have demanded a thorough investigation into their election 
complaints as a precondition for their cooperation in getting the 
national assembly moving and a new government formed. Hun Sen said 
on Friday that the opposition concerns over their safety in the country 
was ``just an excuse for them to stay abroad.'' Both Ranariddh and 
Sam Rainsy have been outside the country since parliament was ceremonially 
opened on Sep. 24. Sam Rainsy and a number of opposition figures have 
been under court investigation for a grenade attack on Hun Sen's Phnom 
Penh residence on Sep. 7. Hun Sen was not home at the time of the 
attack, which was followed by a police crackdown on demonstrators 
contesting Hun Sen's election victory. The Sam Rainsy Party, in a 
statement released Friday, accused Hun Sen of being ``unwilling to 
make any compromise'' on negotiations to break the deadlock. ``A meeting 
outside Cambodia, as suggested by the opposition, could place all 
parties on more equal footing,'' said the statement. ``But the ruling 
party refuses to negotiate unless it is able to threaten its negotiating 
partners with arrest or worse.'' 
 
King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government. Cambodian leader 
Hun Sen's ruling party and the two-party opposition had called on 
the monarch to lead top-level talks, but disagreed on its location. 
``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party. A copy of the letter was obtained 
Thursday. In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.'' Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party. ``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability 
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised 
speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords. Hun 
Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national 
election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government 
on its own. Opposition parties led by Ranariddh and former finance 
minister Sam Ram Rainsy have refused to enter into a coalition with 
Hun Sen until their allegations of election fraud have been thoroughly 
investigated. International monitors said the election was relatively 
free and fair. Hun Sen said his current government would remain in 
power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one. Ranariddh 
and Sam Rainsy have remained outside the country since the Sept. 24 
ceremonial convening of parliament. Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest 
opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating 
inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence 
in Beijing. Hun Sen has rejected the opposition's reservations, saying 
it would be inappropriate to hold a summit outside the country. Negotiations 
so far have proved fruitless except for the opening of parliament 
after a Sept. 22 summit led by the king. Hun Sen implied Thursday 
that the opposition failed to follow through on promises made at the 
summit. ``If those results are strictly respected, there seems no 
reason to hold another summit,'' Hun Sen said in a speech on the anniversary 
of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords. Sihanouk is reportedly set to fly 
to Beijing next month to receive medical treatment from his Chinese 
doctors. The 75-year-old monarch suffers from a variety ailments and 
periodically makes extended trips to Beijing. He was diagnosed with 
colon cancer in 1993, but it has since gone into remission. In September, 
thousands of people filled the streets of Phnom Penh to protest against 
the alleged election fraud. Hun Sen ordered police to break up the 
demonstrations. At least four demonstrators were killed by police, 
but the discovery of more than 20 bodies in the aftermath has prompted 
speculation that the death tally could be much higher. In his speech, 
Hun Sen blamed the violence on opposition leaders, saying the demonstrations 
instigated social and economic chaos. 
 
Cambodia's two-party opposition asked the Asian Development Bank Monday 
to stop providing loans to the incumbent government, which it calls 
illegal. Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue. Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
Meanwhile, it says, the old government is holding power illegally. 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy renewed their international lobbying campaign 
against the old government Monday in a letter to ADB President Mitsuo 
Sato calling for the bank to stop lending money to it. ``We respectfully 
advise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loans to 
the current regime in Cambodia,'' the two party leaders wrote. ``At 
best the current regime could be considered a caretaker government 
as it has not been approved by the National Assembly.'' After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees. ``There have been 
reports that there is an attempt to internationalize the return of 
those members of parliament on the excuse of security problems,'' 
Prak Sokhonn said. ``Some (opposition politicians) have wanted the 
United Nations to help guarantee a safe return for them.'' The U.N. 
secretary-general's representative office in Phnom Penh provided monitors 
to opposition politicians after they returned to Cambodia to participate 
in the July election. The monitoring ended Sept. 30. ``Our office 
has not received any official request for that operation to be started 
up again,'' U.N. diplomat Jonathan Prentice said Monday in reaction 
to Prak Sokhonn's statement. The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, 
but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and 
recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. 
Diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled talks appeared to bear fruit 
Monday as Japanese Foreign Affairs Secretary of State Nobutaka Machimura 
said King Norodom Sihanouk has called on Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
to return to Cambodia. Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
Cambodia's ruling party responded Tuesday to criticisms of its leader 
in the U.S. Congress with a lengthy defense of strongman Hun Sen's 
human rights record. The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding 
resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives 
calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian 
law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution 
include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against 
anti-government demonstrations. A copy of the resolution has since 
been submitted to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. 
``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement. It defended Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh 
as a proper response to the prince's attempts at the time to negotiate 
the defections of senior Khmer Rouge rebels. It also repeated claims 
that the prince's party had moved rebel soldiers into Phnom Penh, 
a contention that remains unproved. The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation. Ranariddh and his core supporters 
did not return to Cambodia until a few months before an election in 
July this year that the ruling party narrowly won. Ranariddh and his 
opposition ally, Sam Rainsy, refused to accept the election results, 
alleging widespread intimidation and fraud by the CPP. When their 
claims were dismissed by a Hun Sen-friendly court, they rallied their 
supporters into the streets of Phnom Penh. After two weeks of tolerating 
the demonstrations, Hun Sen ordered a violent crackdown that resulted 
in the deaths of at least four protesters. U.N. human rights workers 
later discovered more than 20 bodies _ many bearing signs of torture 
_ in and around the capital, prompting speculation that the death 
toll could be much higher. The ruling party supported the police action 
in its statement, noting that public property was damaged by protesters 
and that grenades were thrown at Hun Sen's home after Sam Rainsy suggested 
in a speech that the U.S. government should fire cruise missiles at 
Hun Sen. The opposition claims the grenade attack was staged as an 
excuse to begin the crackdown. ``The leaders of illegal demonstrations 
are the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving 
from the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly 
violence as ``minor incidents.'' The ruling party also reminded the 
United States that Washington supported a Cambodian exile government 
dominated by the brutal Khmer Rouge in the 1980s. The Khmer Rouge 
was responsible for the deaths of as many as 2 million people during 
the guerrilla group's 1975-79 rule of Cambodia. After a series of 
border clashes, the Khmer Rouge was ousted from power by an invading 
Vietnamese army that set up a surrogate Cambodian communist government 
later led by Hun Sen. The ruling party accused U.S. policy-makers 
of not taking timely action to save the Cambodian people from the 
Khmer Rouge. ``They must not make unjust accusations against those 
who led the struggle to liberate the people from genocide,'' it added. 
 
Cambodia's leading opposition party ruled out sharing the presidency 
of Parliament with its arch foe Saturday, insisting it alone must 
occupy the top position in the legislative body. Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government. Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse. The 
prince's party, in a statement dated Friday and seen Saturday, said 
such a scenario was unconstitutional. ``Co-sharing anything with the 
CPP means surrendering full power to them. Furthermore, such a proposal 
is unconstitutional,'' the faxed statement said. The royalist party 
also rejected Hun Sen's calls to hold bilateral talks, insisting that 
Ranariddh's main ally Sam Rainsy also be included. ``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions. Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post. In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Fearing arrest, many opposition members of Parliament left Cambodia 
after the ceremonial opening of the National Assembly on Sep. 24. 
A series of negotiations to forge a new government have failed. The 
talks have been complicated by the CPP-FUNCINPEC quarrel over the 
Parliament's top job. Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government. FUNCINPEC has demanded from Hun Sen written guarantees 
for the safety of its members and activities as a precondition for 
re-entering negotiations. 
 
Cambodia's bickering political parties broke a three-month deadlock 
Friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun 
Sen as sole prime minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced. In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party 
dropped insistence on a joint assembly chairmanship shared by Ranariddh 
and party boss Chea Sim, the current speaker. It was one of the main 
stumbling blocks in months of discord. Instead, Sihanouk announced, 
the constitution will be modified to create a new Senate, which Chea 
Sim will head. Chea Sim will still serve as acting head of state during 
the king's frequent absences from the country. ``The major political 
crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock 
facing the nation has also come to an end,'' the king said in his 
statement. The Senate will initially be appointed by the king. The 
agreement did not say how many seats there would be, nor how they 
would be divided. The parties will hammer out details later. Pok Than, 
one of Ranariddh's negotiators, said the Senate would serve a mostly 
advisory role to the assembly. The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies. The two parties 
said that the assembly would convene again Nov. 25. The agreement 
came surprisingly quickly following Ranariddh's return Thursday from 
Thailand, where he had been holed up with other opposition figures 
for weeks amid fears for their safety if they stayed in Cambodia. 
The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid. It could also hasten Cambodia's entry 
into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, put on hold last 
year after Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody 
coup. Earlier, as both sides arrived at the Royal Palace for a second 
day of meetings, Sihanouk said they had agreed in principle to form 
a coalition and made ``important concessions.'' The king, the sole 
force in Cambodian politics able to broker a deal, pressured both 
sides to reach agreement before he leaves Saturday for medical treatment 
in Beijing. Sihanouk reported that Hun Sen responded positively to 
a request by Ranariddh for five of his key supporters to receive political 
pardons. All five were convicted of political crimes by courts that 
are widely seen as loyal to Hun Sen. The king has powers to grant 
pardons, but has awaited agreement from Hun Sen in politically sensitive 
cases. Former battlefield enemies, the CPP and FUNCINPEC have been 
at loggerheads since the CPP narrowly won parliamentary elections 
in July. The vote failed to put an end to instability that followed 
last year's coup. The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to form a government alone. Ranariddh's party and opposition ally 
Sam Rainsy held back their support, claiming the CPP won due to fraud 
and intimidation. The opposition organized protests in Phnom Penh 
seeking Hun Sen's ouster that were violently dispersed. Sam Rainsy, 
under investigation by a Phnom Penh court for his role in the demonstrations, 
has remained abroad. His 15 seats in the 122-seat assembly are irrelevant 
to forming a working government. 
 
Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge. Their arguments turned bloody last year when Hun Sen 
ousted Ranariddh in a coup. The prince fled Cambodia and did not return 
until a few months before elections in July. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations. After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly. ``This will not be a repetition 
of 1993 because there will not be two prime ministers,'' said Hun 
Sen aide Prak Sokhon, who attended last week's summit. ``When we had 
two prime ministers, everything moved very slowly and decisions were 
made more politically than technically.'' Ranariddh said Saturday 
that the two parties agreed to keep the ministries of interior and 
defense under co-ministers. Senior FUNCINPEC official Ahmad Yahya 
revealed Monday that it was also agreed that the CPP would control 
the foreign affairs and finance portfolios. FUNCINPEC will take justice 
and information. The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate. Hun Sen and Ranariddh are scheduled to meet 
Nov. 23 _ two days before parliament reopens _ to review the results 
of the working groups and give their final approval, Ahmad Yahya said. 
Their ability to repair their relationship and work together will 
be the key to a stable coalition. ``I consider this a remarriage,'' 
Ahmad Yahya said. ``They have to be careful with the way they work 
and what they say. They will have to compromise to achieve results.'' 
Ranariddh's ally, Sam Rainsy, whose party placed a distant third in 
the election, was left out of last week's deal. Sam Rainsy, a virulent 
critic of Hun Sen, and his party's 14 other members of parliament 
have remained outside Cambodia since September amid fears for their 
security. In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Monday, Sam 
Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament. Sam Rainsy said he had been told by Ranariddh that 
his party and former Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been implicated by 
Hun Sen in a rocket attack on the Sept. 24 opening of parliament. 
Authorities have called it an assassination attempt on Hun Sen. A 
police general investigating the attack said Monday that likely suspects 
have been identified, but he would not reveal names or their political 
affiliation. 
 
Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country. The assurances 
were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun 
Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices 
in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind 
a plot against his life. Sam Rainsy and the 14 members of parliament 
from his party have been holed up overseas for two months. But a deal 
reached between Hun Sen and his chief rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, 
on forming a new government last week has opened the door for their 
return. In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied 
to all politicians. His assurances come a week before the first session 
of Cambodia's new parliament, the National Assembly. Sam Rainsy said 
Wednesday that he was unsatisfied with the guarantee. He said it contained 
indirect language and loopholes that suggest he and his Sam Rainsy 
Party members are still under threat of arrest from Hun Sen's ruling 
party. ``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members 
of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' 
the opposition leader said in a statement. ``But instead they make 
roundabout statements, full of loopholes that can easily be exploited 
by a legal system that is completely in their control.'' Ranariddh 
told reporters Wednesday that he believed it was safe for Sam Rainsy 
in Cambodia. Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government. Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly. The deal assures 
the two-thirds vote in parliament needed to approve a new government. 
The men served as co-prime ministers until Hun Sen overthrew Ranariddh 
in a coup last year. ``I think Hun Sen has got everything. He's got 
the premiership and legitimacy through the election and recognition 
from his majesty the king. I don't think there is any benefit for 
Hun Sen to cause instability for our country,'' Ranariddh said. The 
prince also said that his top general, Nhek Bunchhay, would not be 
given back his previous position as the second-ranking general in 
the Cambodian military's general staff. Nhek Bunchhay's outnumbered 
forces in the capital put up tough but unsuccessful resistance to 
last year's coup. 
 
Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia. Hun 
Sen announced a government guarantee Wednesday of all politicians' 
safety and their right to conduct political activities ``in accordance 
with the laws in force.'' Sam Rainsy, who earlier called Hun Sen's 
statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election. Sam Rainsy, a staunch critic of Hun Sen, was 
forced to take refuge in a U.N. office in September to avoid arrest 
after Hun Sen accused him of being behind a plot against his life. 
The alleged assassination attempt came during massive street demonstrations 
organized by the opposition after Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party 
narrowly won the election. The opposition, alleging widespread fraud 
and intimidation, refused to accept the results of the polls. Fearing 
for their safety, Sam Rainsy and his then-ally Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
led an exodus of opposition lawmakers out of Cambodia after parliament 
was ceremonially opened in late September. Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government. The 
agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president 
of the National Assembly. The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament. Sok An, representing 
Hun Sen's party, said Friday that one working group had completed 
its work on a joint political platform to be implemented by the new 
government. The platform is said to emphasize administrative, economic 
and judicial reforms, but Sok An would not reveal details, saying 
Hun Sen would announce it when he presents his Cabinet choices to 
the National Assembly. 
 
King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's 
top two political parties _ previously bitter rivals _ to form a coalition 
government led by strongman Hun Sen. In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
``The protocol on cooperation between the CPP and FUNCINPEC will certainly 
bring peace and progress to our nation and people,'' Sihanouk wrote. 
Uncompromising enemies just a few months ago, Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC 
President Prince Norodom Ranariddh agreed Nov. 13 to form a government 
at a summit convened by Sihanouk. The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly. Sihanouk, recalling 
procedures used in a past government, suggested Tuesday that he should 
appoint the first two members of the upper house. The remaining senators, 
he said, should be selected by a method agreed upon by the new government 
and the National Assembly. Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly. Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties. 
","Prospects were dim for resolution of the political crisis in Cambodia in October 1998.
Prime Minister Hun Sen insisted that talks take place in Cambodia while opposition leaders Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, fearing arrest at home, wanted them abroad.
King Sihanouk declined to chair talks in either place.
A U.S. House resolution criticized Hun Sen's regime while the opposition tried to cut off his access to loans.
But in November the King announced a coalition government with Hun Sen heading the executive and Ranariddh leading the parliament.
Left out, Sam Rainsy sought the King's assurance of Hun Sen's promise of safety and freedom for all politicians.

"
Honduras braced for potential catastrophe Tuesday as Hurricane Mitch 
roared through the northwest Caribbean, churning up high waves and 
intense rain that sent coastal residents scurrying for safer ground. 
President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of maximum alert 
and the Honduran military sent planes to pluck residents from their 
homes on islands near the coast. At 0900 GMT Tuesday, Mitch was 95 
miles (152 kilometers) north of Honduras, near the Swan Islands. With 
winds near 180 mph (289 kph), and even higher gusts, it was a Category 
5 monster _ the highest, most dangerous rating for a storm. The 350-mile 
(560-kilometer) wide hurricane was moving west at 8 mph (12 kph). 
``Mitch is closing in,'' said Monterrey Cardenas, mayor of Utila, 
an island 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the Honduran coast. ``And God 
help us.'' Mitch posed no immediate threat to the United States, forecasters 
said, but was expected to remain in the northwest Caribbean for five 
days. The U.S. National Weather Service in Miami said Mitch could 
weaken somewhat, but warned it would still remain ``a very dangerous 
hurricane capable of causing catastrophic damage.'' The entire coast 
of Honduras was under a hurricane warning and up to 15 inches (38 
centimeters) of rain was forecast in mountain areas. The Honduran 
president closed schools and public offices on the coast Monday and 
ordered all air force planes and helicopters to evacuate people from 
the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the country's 
central coast. The head of the Honduran armed forces, Gen. Mario Hung 
Pacheco, said 5,000 soldiers were standing by to help victims of the 
storm, but he warned the military could not reach everyone. ``For 
that humanitarian work, we would need more than 300 Hercules C-137 
planes,'' he said. ``Honduras doesn't have them.'' A hurricane warning 
was also in effect for the Caribbean coast of Guatemala. In Belize, 
a hurricane watch was in place and the government also closed schools 
and sent workers home early Monday. Panic buying stripped bread from 
the shelves of some stores and some gasoline stations ran dry. Coastal 
Belize City was hit so hard by Hurricane Hattie in 1961 that the country 
built a new capital inland at Belmopan. Mexico mobilized troops and 
emergency workers Monday on the east coast of the Yucatan peninsula, 
which was also under a hurricane watch, and Cuba said it had evacuated 
600 vacationers from the Island of Youth. Jerry Jarrell, the weather 
center director, said Mitch was the strongest hurricane to strike 
the Caribbean since 1988, when Gilbert killed more than 300 people. 
In La Ceiba, on Honduras' northern coast, people stood in long lines 
at filling stations Monday to buy gasoline under a steady rain. Maria 
Gonzalez said she needed the gas to cook with when her firewood gets 
wet. Still, she bought only 37 cents worth _ all she could afford. 
``I have six children, and we live in a riverbed,'' she said. ``If 
it gets really bad, we'll go to the church and see what the architect 
of the world has in store for us.'' Swinwick Jackson, a fisherman 
on Utila, had tied up his boats and was taking his family to stay 
with a relative on higher ground. National police spokesman Ivan Mejia 
said the Coco, Segovia and Cruta rivers all overflowed their banks 
Monday along Honduras' eastern coast. ``Frightened people are moving 
into the mountains to search for shelter,'' he said. In El Progreso, 
100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, 
the army evacuated more than 5,000 people who live in low-lying banana 
plantations along the Ulua River, said Nolly Soliman, a resident. 
Before bearing down on Honduras, Mitch swept past Jamaica and the 
Cayman Islands. Rain squalls flooded streets in the Jamaican capital, 
Kingston, and government offices and schools closed in the Caymans, 
a British colony of 28,000 people. The strongest hurricane to hit 
Honduras in recent memory was Fifi in 1974, which ravaged Honduras' 
Caribbean coast, killing at least 2,000 people. 
 
Hurricane Mitch paused in its whirl through the western Caribbean 
on Wednesday to punish Honduras with 120-mph (205-kph) winds, topping 
trees, sweeping away bridges, flooding neighborhoods and killing at 
least 32 people. Mitch was drifting west at only 2 mph (3 kph) over 
the Bay Islands, Honduras' most popular tourist area. It also was 
only 30 miles (50 kms) off the coast, and hurricane-force winds stretched 
outward 105 miles (165 kms); tropical storm-force winds 175 miles 
(280 kms). That meant the Honduran coast had been under hurricane 
conditions for more than a day. ``The hurricane has destroyed almost 
everything,'' said Mike Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island which 
was within miles (kms) of the eye of the hurricane. ``Few houses have 
remained standing.'' At its, 4th graf pvs 
 
Hurricane Mitch cut through the Honduran coast like a ripsaw Thursday, 
its devastating winds whirling for a third day through resort islands 
and mainland communities. At least 32 people were killed and widespread 
flooding prompted more than 150,000 to seek higher ground. Mitch, 
once among the century's most powerful hurricanes, weakened today 
as it blasted this Central American nation, bringing downpours that 
flooded at least 50 rivers. It also kicked up huge waves that pounded 
seaside communities. The storm's power was easing and by 1200 GMT, 
it had sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph), down from 100 mph (160 
kph) around midnight and well below its 180 mph (290 kph) peak of 
early Tuesday. After remaining virtually stationary for more than 
a day, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Thursday the center 
of the 350-mile-wide (560-kilometer-wide) storm had moved slightly 
to the south but remained just off the Honduran coast. Hurricane-force 
winds whirled up to 30 miles (50 kilometers) from the center, with 
rain-laden tropical storm winds extending well beyond that. Caught 
near the heart of the storm were the Bay Islands, about 25 miles (40 
kilometers) off Honduras' coast and popular with divers and beachcombers. 
``The hurricane has destroyed almost everything,'' said Mike Brown, 
a resident of Guanaja Island, 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the coast. 
``Few houses have remained standing.'' Honduran officials said 14 
people had died on that small island alone, and at least nine had 
died elsewhere in the country. More than 72,000 people had been evacuated 
to shelters. Nine other deaths had been reported elsewhere in the 
region by early Thursday _ more than a day after Mitch drifted to 
just off the coast and seemed to park there. An American was thrown 
from his boat south of Cancun, Mexico, on Monday and was presumed 
dead. Eight others died in Nicaragua in flooding. Honduran officials 
said more than 200 towns and villages had been isolated by the storm, 
left without power, telephones or clean drinking water. Agriculture 
Minister Pedro Arturo Sevilla said crucial grain, citrus and banana 
crops had been damaged ``and the economic future of Honduras is uncertain.'' 
Rain-swollen rivers knocked out bridges and roads, isolating La Ceiba, 
a coastal city of 40,000 people located 80 miles (128 kilometers) 
from the Bay Islands. About 10,000 residents fled to crowded shelters 
in schools, churches and firehouses. While supplies of food and gasoline 
seemed to hold up, drivers worried about the coming days formed long 
lines to fill their tanks at gas stations and some supermarkets took 
measures to limit panic buying. La Ceiba officials appealed for pure 
water for those in shelters and some residents set out plastic buckets 
to collect rainwater. Only a few hotels and offices with their own 
generators had electricity. Wind-whipped waves almost buried some 
houses near the shore. People evacuated low-lying houses by wading 
through chest-deep water with sodden bags of belongings on their heads. 
In neighboring Belize, most of the 75,000 residents of coastal Belize 
City had left by Wednesday, turning the country's largest city into 
a ghost town. Police and soldiers patrolled the streets, and a few 
people wandered amid the boarded-up houses. The cable television company 
was broadcasting only The Weather Channel. With the storm seemingly 
anchored off Honduras, officials in Mexico to the north eased emergency 
measures on the Caribbean coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, where hundreds 
of people remained in shelters as a precaution Wednesday night. More 
than 20,000 tourists had abandoned Cancun and nearby resort areas, 
leaving hotels at about 20 percent of capacity. Houston accountant 
Kathy Montgomery said that she and her friend Nina Devries had tried 
to leave Cancun but found all the flights full. ``It's been horrible,'' 
said Montgomery, as she and her friend drank cocktails at an outdoor 
restaurant. ``We couldn't go out on a boat, we couldn't go snorkeling. 
``Even Carlos' N Charlie's and Senor Frog's are closed,'' she said 
dejectedly, referring to two restaurants. ``Some vacation.'' The U.S. 
Agency for International Development sent two helicopters each to 
Belize and Honduras to help in search, rescue and relief efforts. 
At its peak, Mitch was the fourth-strongest Caribbean hurricane in 
this century, behind Gilbert in 1988, Allen in 1980 and the Labor 
Day hurricane of 1935. 
 
At least 231 people have been confirmed dead in Honduras from former-hurricane

In Honduras, at least 231 deaths have been blamed on Mitch, the National 
Emergency Commission said Saturday. El Salvador _ where 140 people 
died in flash floods _ declared a state of emergency Saturday, as 
did Guatemala, where 21 people died when floods swept away their homes. 
Mexico reported one death from Mitch last Monday. In the Caribbean, 
the U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a tourist schooner with 
31 people aboard that hasn't been heard from since Tuesday. By late 
Sunday, Mitch's winds, once near 180 mph (290 kph), had dropped to 
near 30 mph (50 kph), and the storm _ now classified as a tropical 
depression _ was near Tapachula, on Mexico's southern Pacific coast 
near the Guatemalan border. Mitch was moving west at 8 mph (13 kph) 
and was dissipating but threatened to strengthen again if it moved 
back out to sea. 
 
Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said Sunday night that between 
1,000 and 1,500 people were buried in a 32-square mile (82.88 square-kilometer) 
area below the slopes of the Casita volcano in northern Nicaragua. 
That is in addition to least another 600 people elsewhere in the country, 
Bolanos said. 
 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Tuesday approved 6.4 
million European currency units (dlrs 7.7 million) in aid for thousands 
of victims of the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch in Central 
America. EU spokesman Pietro Petrucci said the funds will be used 
to provide basic care such as medicine, food, water sanitation and 
blankets to thousands of people whose homes were destroyed by torrential 
rains and mudslides. The aid will be distributed in Nicaragua, El 
Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala which have most suffered from Mitch's 
deadly passage, the EU executive Commission said in a statement. Officials 
in Central America estimated Tuesday that about 7,000 people have 
died in the region. The greatest losses were reported in Honduras, 
where an estimated 5,000 people died and 600,000 people _ 10 percent 
of the population _ were forced to flee their homes after last week's 
storm. El Salvador's National Emergency Committee listed 174 dead, 
96 missing and 27,000 homeless. But its own regional affiliate in 
San Miguel province reported 125 dead there alone. Guatemala reported 
100 storm-related deaths. The latest EU aid follows an initial 400,000 
ecu (dlrs 480,000). the EU approved for the region on Friday. The 
full 6.8 million ecu (dlrs 8.18 million) will be channeled through 
humanitarian groups working in the region. 
 
Pope John Paul II appealed for aid Wednesday for the Central American 
countries stricken by hurricane Mitch and said he feels close to the 
thousands who are suffering. Speaking during his general audience, 
the pope urged ``all public and private institutions and all men of 
good will'' to do all they can ``in this grave moment of destruction 
and death.'' Hurricane Mitch killed an estimated 9,000 people throughout 
Central America in a disaster of such proportions that relief agencies 
have been overwhelmed. Among those attending the audience were six 
Russian cosmonauts taking a special course in Italy. As a gift, they 
gave John Paul a spacesuit. 
 
Better information from Honduras' ravaged countryside enabled officials 
to lower the confirmed death toll from Hurricane Mitch from 7,000 
to about 6,100 on Thursday, but leaders insisted the need for help 
was growing. President Carlos Flores declared Hurricane Mitch had 
set back Honduras' development by 50 years. He urged the more than 
1.5 million Hondurans affected by the storm to help with the recovery 
effort. ``The county is semi-destroyed and awaits the maximum effort 
and most fervent and constant work of every one of its children,'' 
he said. In the capital, Tegucigalpa, Mexican rescue teams began searching 
for avalanche victims. Honduran doctors dispensed vaccinations to 
prevent disease outbreaks in shelters crammed with refugees. As of 
Thursday, Mitch had killed 6,076 people in Honduras _ down from officials' 
earlier estimate of 7,000. The numbers of missing dropped from an 
estimated 11,000 to 4,621, Government Minister Delmer Urbizo said. 
``We have more access to places affected by the storm,'' Urbizo explained. 
``Until now, we have had a short amount of time and few resources 
to get reliable information.'' In Nicaragua, around 2,000 people were 
killed, most of those swept away when a volcano crater lake collapsed 
a week ago. El Salvador reported 239 dead; Guatemala said 194 of its 
people had been killed. Six people died in southern Mexico and seven 
in Costa Rica. Aid groups and governments have called for other countries 
to send medicine, water, canned food, roofing materials and equipment 
to help deliver supplies. In Washington on Thursday, President Bill 
Clinton ordered dlrs 30 million in Defense Department equipment and 
services and dlrs 36 million in food, fuel and other aid be sent to 
Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. The White House also 
said Clinton was dispatching Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al 
Gore, to Central America on a mission to show the U.S. commitment 
to providing humanitarian relief. Hillary Rodham Clinton also will 
travel to the region, visiting Nicaragua and Honduras on Nov. 16. 
She later will stop in El Salvador and Guatemala before continuing 
on to Haiti and the Dominican Republic for a visit that had been canceled 
due to Hurricane Georges, which struck the Caribbean in October. Mitch, 
which sat off the Honduran coast for several days last week, destroyed 
scores of Central American communities before moving northwest. The 
weakened storm crossed southern Florida on Thursday, damaging mobile 
homes and buildings and injuring at least seven people. Countries 
overwhelmed by the storm's devastation have only just begun to calculate 
the damage. Honduran authorities still don't know how many shelters 
have been set up across the Central American country. Surveyors have 
yet to evaluate roughly 10 percent of the most affected areas _ the 
departments of Cortes, Atlantida, Colon and Yoro in the north, southern 
Choluteca and Valle, and the central department of Francisco Morazan, 
which includes the capital. Numbers still can vary wildly. The estimated 
number of homeless dropped from 580,000 to 569,000 Thursday. Mitch 
damaged or destroyed at least 90 bridges on major highways, including 
most spans on Highway 5, the main north-south route, officials said. 
Urbizo said Honduran officials hoped the scale of need in next-door 
Nicaragua wouldn't overshadow Honduras' plight. ``Our problem is that 
all of the country has been affected,'' he said. Thursday's relief 
operations paled in comparison to the scope of the disaster. A total 
of 14 helicopter relief missions were delivering aid to stricken towns, 
said Col. Roger Antonio Caceres of the government's Operation Mitch 
emergency response task force. ``We can manage with the number of 
aircraft we have because there is little to distribute,'' Caceres 
said. More help was on the way. Mexico was sending 700 tons of food, 
11 tons of medicine, at least 12 helicopters, four cargo planes and 
475 soldiers to help in relief operations. The United States committed 
19 Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters, two C-27 aircraft and one C-130 
cargo plane. France said it was sending 250 rescue workers to Central 
America, along with a ship loaded with construction material and equipment. 
The U.N. World Food Program said Thursday it was diverting ships, 
some already at sea, to rush their cargoes of donated food to Central 
America. It also was pulling food from warehouses at its base in Rome, 
probably for delivery by emergency relief flights, spokesman Trevor 
Rowe said. ``We're trying to move food as fast as possible to help 
people as soon as possible,'' Rowe said. Searches for the missing 
continued, and some decomposed bodies, once found, were being buried 
in common graves. About 100 victims had been buried around Tegucigalpa, 
Mayor Nahum Valladeres said. In the flood-ravaged Tegucigalpa neighborhood 
of Nueva Esperanza, Mexican military rescuers loaded search dogs on 
their backs and forded a muddy river to look for people believed buried 
in a 200-foot (60-meter) avalanche that occurred last Friday. Dozens 
of homes were swept into the river. ``This is the first place we've 
been'' with the dogs, Honduran army Maj. Freddy Diaz Celaya said. 
``From here we'll continue searching downriver.'' Concerned that crowded 
shelter conditions could produce outbreaks of hepatitis, respiratory 
infections and other ailments, the Health Ministry announced an inoculation 
campaign, especially for children. Doctors volunteering at a shelter 
housing 4,000 people at Tegucigalpa's Polytechnic Development Institute 
said they'd heard of the campaign but had yet to receive word or medicines 
from the Health Ministry. ``We have to vaccinate the children,'' said 
Dr. Mario Soto, who has treated at least 300 children at the shelter 
for diarrhea, conjunctivitis and bacterial infections. 
 
Aid workers struggled Friday to reach survivors of Hurricane Mitch, 
who are in danger of dying from starvation and disease in the wake 
of the storm that officials estimate killed more than 10,000 people. 
Foreign aid and pledges of assistance poured into Central America, 
but damage to roads and bridges reduced the amount of supplies reaching 
hundreds of isolated communities to a trickle: only as much as could 
be dropped from a helicopter, when the aircraft can get through. In 
the Aguan River Valley in northern Honduras, floodwaters have receded, 
leaving a carpet of mud over hundreds of acres (hectares). In many 
nearby villages, residents have gone days without potable water or 
food. A 7-month-old baby died in the village of Olvido after three 
days without food. Residents feared more children would die. ``The 
worst thing, the saddest thing, are the children. The children are 
suffering, even dying,'' said the Rev. Cecilio Escobar Gallindo, the 
parish priest. A score of cargo aircraft landed Thursday at the normally 
quiet Toncontin airport in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, delivering 
aid from Mexico, the United States, Japan and Argentina. Former U.S. 
President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, intended to visit Nicaragua 
on Friday to learn more about the hurricane's impact, The Carter Center 
in Atlanta announced. ``We hope this visit will help call attention 
to the suffering and humanitarian need this disaster has created,'' 
Carter said in a statement. U.S. President Bill Clinton requested 
a ``global relief effort'' to help Central America and boosted U.S. 
emergency aid to dlrs 70 million. Clinton is dispatching a delegation 
next week led by Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, to deliver 
some of the supplies destined for Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador 
and Guatemala. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton added Nicaragua and 
Honduras to a trip she plans to the region beginning Nov. 16. Taiwan 
said today it will donate dlrs 2.6 million in relief to Honduras, 
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. The four countries are among 
a dwindling number of nations that recognize Taiwan, which China claims 
is a breakaway province. Two British ships that were in the area on 
an exercise were on their way to Honduras to join relief efforts, 
the Defense Ministry said Friday. ``It's a coincidence that the ships 
are there but they've got men and equipment that can be put to work 
in an organized way,'' said International Development Secretary Clare 
Short. Nicaragua said Friday it will accept Cuba's offer to send doctors 
as long as the communist nation flies them in on its own helicopters 
and with their own supplies. Nicaraguan leaders previously had refused 
Cuba's offer of medical help, saying it did not have the means to 
transport or support the doctors. Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistas, 
who maintained close relations with Fidel Castro during their 1979-90 
rule, had criticized the refusal by President Arnoldo Aleman's administration. 
","Hurricane Mitch approached Honduras on Oct. 27, 1998 with winds up to 180mph a Category 5 storm.
It hit the Honduran coast on Oct. 28 bringing downpours that forced large-scale evacuations.

By then Mitch's winds were down to 30mph, but as disaster reports poured in the death toll finally exceeded 10,000 and half a million left homeless.

Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Friday rejected opposition parties' demands 
for talks outside the country, accusing them of trying to ``internationalize'' 
the political crisis. Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed. Opposition leaders Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition 
figures after two alleged attempts on his life, said they could not 
negotiate freely in Cambodia and called for talks at Sihanouk's residence 
in Beijing. Hun Sen, however, rejected that. ``I would like to make 
it clear that all meetings related to Cambodian affairs must be conducted 
in the Kingdom of Cambodia,'' Hun Sen told reporters after a Cabinet 
meeting on Friday. ``No-one should internationalize Cambodian affairs. 
It is detrimental to the sovereignty of Cambodia,'' he said. Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in 
July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form 
a government on its own. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have charged that 
Hun Sen's victory in the elections was achieved through widespread 
fraud. They have demanded a thorough investigation into their election 
complaints as a precondition for their cooperation in getting the 
national assembly moving and a new government formed. Hun Sen said 
on Friday that the opposition concerns over their safety in the country 
was ``just an excuse for them to stay abroad.'' Both Ranariddh and 
Sam Rainsy have been outside the country since parliament was ceremonially 
opened on Sep. 24. Sam Rainsy and a number of opposition figures have 
been under court investigation for a grenade attack on Hun Sen's Phnom 
Penh residence on Sep. 7. Hun Sen was not home at the time of the 
attack, which was followed by a police crackdown on demonstrators 
contesting Hun Sen's election victory. The Sam Rainsy Party, in a 
statement released Friday, accused Hun Sen of being ``unwilling to 
make any compromise'' on negotiations to break the deadlock. ``A meeting 
outside Cambodia, as suggested by the opposition, could place all 
parties on more equal footing,'' said the statement. ``But the ruling 
party refuses to negotiate unless it is able to threaten its negotiating 
partners with arrest or worse.'' 
 
King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government. Cambodian leader 
Hun Sen's ruling party and the two-party opposition had called on 
the monarch to lead top-level talks, but disagreed on its location. 
``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party. A copy of the letter was obtained 
Thursday. In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.'' Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party. ``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability 
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised 
speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords. Hun 
Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national 
election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government 
on its own. Opposition parties led by Ranariddh and former finance 
minister Sam Ram Rainsy have refused to enter into a coalition with 
Hun Sen until their allegations of election fraud have been thoroughly 
investigated. International monitors said the election was relatively 
free and fair. Hun Sen said his current government would remain in 
power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one. Ranariddh 
and Sam Rainsy have remained outside the country since the Sept. 24 
ceremonial convening of parliament. Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest 
opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating 
inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence 
in Beijing. Hun Sen has rejected the opposition's reservations, saying 
it would be inappropriate to hold a summit outside the country. Negotiations 
so far have proved fruitless except for the opening of parliament 
after a Sept. 22 summit led by the king. Hun Sen implied Thursday 
that the opposition failed to follow through on promises made at the 
summit. ``If those results are strictly respected, there seems no 
reason to hold another summit,'' Hun Sen said in a speech on the anniversary 
of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords. Sihanouk is reportedly set to fly 
to Beijing next month to receive medical treatment from his Chinese 
doctors. The 75-year-old monarch suffers from a variety ailments and 
periodically makes extended trips to Beijing. He was diagnosed with 
colon cancer in 1993, but it has since gone into remission. In September, 
thousands of people filled the streets of Phnom Penh to protest against 
the alleged election fraud. Hun Sen ordered police to break up the 
demonstrations. At least four demonstrators were killed by police, 
but the discovery of more than 20 bodies in the aftermath has prompted 
speculation that the death tally could be much higher. In his speech, 
Hun Sen blamed the violence on opposition leaders, saying the demonstrations 
instigated social and economic chaos. 
 
Cambodia's two-party opposition asked the Asian Development Bank Monday 
to stop providing loans to the incumbent government, which it calls 
illegal. Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue. Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
Meanwhile, it says, the old government is holding power illegally. 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy renewed their international lobbying campaign 
against the old government Monday in a letter to ADB President Mitsuo 
Sato calling for the bank to stop lending money to it. ``We respectfully 
advise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loans to 
the current regime in Cambodia,'' the two party leaders wrote. ``At 
best the current regime could be considered a caretaker government 
as it has not been approved by the National Assembly.'' After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees. ``There have been 
reports that there is an attempt to internationalize the return of 
those members of parliament on the excuse of security problems,'' 
Prak Sokhonn said. ``Some (opposition politicians) have wanted the 
United Nations to help guarantee a safe return for them.'' The U.N. 
secretary-general's representative office in Phnom Penh provided monitors 
to opposition politicians after they returned to Cambodia to participate 
in the July election. The monitoring ended Sept. 30. ``Our office 
has not received any official request for that operation to be started 
up again,'' U.N. diplomat Jonathan Prentice said Monday in reaction 
to Prak Sokhonn's statement. The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, 
but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and 
recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. 
Diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled talks appeared to bear fruit 
Monday as Japanese Foreign Affairs Secretary of State Nobutaka Machimura 
said King Norodom Sihanouk has called on Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
to return to Cambodia. Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
Cambodia's ruling party responded Tuesday to criticisms of its leader 
in the U.S. Congress with a lengthy defense of strongman Hun Sen's 
human rights record. The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding 
resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives 
calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian 
law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution 
include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against 
anti-government demonstrations. A copy of the resolution has since 
been submitted to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. 
``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement. It defended Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh 
as a proper response to the prince's attempts at the time to negotiate 
the defections of senior Khmer Rouge rebels. It also repeated claims 
that the prince's party had moved rebel soldiers into Phnom Penh, 
a contention that remains unproved. The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation. Ranariddh and his core supporters 
did not return to Cambodia until a few months before an election in 
July this year that the ruling party narrowly won. Ranariddh and his 
opposition ally, Sam Rainsy, refused to accept the election results, 
alleging widespread intimidation and fraud by the CPP. When their 
claims were dismissed by a Hun Sen-friendly court, they rallied their 
supporters into the streets of Phnom Penh. After two weeks of tolerating 
the demonstrations, Hun Sen ordered a violent crackdown that resulted 
in the deaths of at least four protesters. U.N. human rights workers 
later discovered more than 20 bodies _ many bearing signs of torture 
_ in and around the capital, prompting speculation that the death 
toll could be much higher. The ruling party supported the police action 
in its statement, noting that public property was damaged by protesters 
and that grenades were thrown at Hun Sen's home after Sam Rainsy suggested 
in a speech that the U.S. government should fire cruise missiles at 
Hun Sen. The opposition claims the grenade attack was staged as an 
excuse to begin the crackdown. ``The leaders of illegal demonstrations 
are the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving 
from the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly 
violence as ``minor incidents.'' The ruling party also reminded the 
United States that Washington supported a Cambodian exile government 
dominated by the brutal Khmer Rouge in the 1980s. The Khmer Rouge 
was responsible for the deaths of as many as 2 million people during 
the guerrilla group's 1975-79 rule of Cambodia. After a series of 
border clashes, the Khmer Rouge was ousted from power by an invading 
Vietnamese army that set up a surrogate Cambodian communist government 
later led by Hun Sen. The ruling party accused U.S. policy-makers 
of not taking timely action to save the Cambodian people from the 
Khmer Rouge. ``They must not make unjust accusations against those 
who led the struggle to liberate the people from genocide,'' it added. 
 
Cambodia's leading opposition party ruled out sharing the presidency 
of Parliament with its arch foe Saturday, insisting it alone must 
occupy the top position in the legislative body. Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government. Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse. The 
prince's party, in a statement dated Friday and seen Saturday, said 
such a scenario was unconstitutional. ``Co-sharing anything with the 
CPP means surrendering full power to them. Furthermore, such a proposal 
is unconstitutional,'' the faxed statement said. The royalist party 
also rejected Hun Sen's calls to hold bilateral talks, insisting that 
Ranariddh's main ally Sam Rainsy also be included. ``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions. Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post. In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Fearing arrest, many opposition members of Parliament left Cambodia 
after the ceremonial opening of the National Assembly on Sep. 24. 
A series of negotiations to forge a new government have failed. The 
talks have been complicated by the CPP-FUNCINPEC quarrel over the 
Parliament's top job. Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government. FUNCINPEC has demanded from Hun Sen written guarantees 
for the safety of its members and activities as a precondition for 
re-entering negotiations. 
 
Cambodia's bickering political parties broke a three-month deadlock 
Friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun 
Sen as sole prime minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced. In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party 
dropped insistence on a joint assembly chairmanship shared by Ranariddh 
and party boss Chea Sim, the current speaker. It was one of the main 
stumbling blocks in months of discord. Instead, Sihanouk announced, 
the constitution will be modified to create a new Senate, which Chea 
Sim will head. Chea Sim will still serve as acting head of state during 
the king's frequent absences from the country. ``The major political 
crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock 
facing the nation has also come to an end,'' the king said in his 
statement. The Senate will initially be appointed by the king. The 
agreement did not say how many seats there would be, nor how they 
would be divided. The parties will hammer out details later. Pok Than, 
one of Ranariddh's negotiators, said the Senate would serve a mostly 
advisory role to the assembly. The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies. The two parties 
said that the assembly would convene again Nov. 25. The agreement 
came surprisingly quickly following Ranariddh's return Thursday from 
Thailand, where he had been holed up with other opposition figures 
for weeks amid fears for their safety if they stayed in Cambodia. 
The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid. It could also hasten Cambodia's entry 
into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, put on hold last 
year after Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody 
coup. Earlier, as both sides arrived at the Royal Palace for a second 
day of meetings, Sihanouk said they had agreed in principle to form 
a coalition and made ``important concessions.'' The king, the sole 
force in Cambodian politics able to broker a deal, pressured both 
sides to reach agreement before he leaves Saturday for medical treatment 
in Beijing. Sihanouk reported that Hun Sen responded positively to 
a request by Ranariddh for five of his key supporters to receive political 
pardons. All five were convicted of political crimes by courts that 
are widely seen as loyal to Hun Sen. The king has powers to grant 
pardons, but has awaited agreement from Hun Sen in politically sensitive 
cases. Former battlefield enemies, the CPP and FUNCINPEC have been 
at loggerheads since the CPP narrowly won parliamentary elections 
in July. The vote failed to put an end to instability that followed 
last year's coup. The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to form a government alone. Ranariddh's party and opposition ally 
Sam Rainsy held back their support, claiming the CPP won due to fraud 
and intimidation. The opposition organized protests in Phnom Penh 
seeking Hun Sen's ouster that were violently dispersed. Sam Rainsy, 
under investigation by a Phnom Penh court for his role in the demonstrations, 
has remained abroad. His 15 seats in the 122-seat assembly are irrelevant 
to forming a working government. 
 
Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge. Their arguments turned bloody last year when Hun Sen 
ousted Ranariddh in a coup. The prince fled Cambodia and did not return 
until a few months before elections in July. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations. After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly. ``This will not be a repetition 
of 1993 because there will not be two prime ministers,'' said Hun 
Sen aide Prak Sokhon, who attended last week's summit. ``When we had 
two prime ministers, everything moved very slowly and decisions were 
made more politically than technically.'' Ranariddh said Saturday 
that the two parties agreed to keep the ministries of interior and 
defense under co-ministers. Senior FUNCINPEC official Ahmad Yahya 
revealed Monday that it was also agreed that the CPP would control 
the foreign affairs and finance portfolios. FUNCINPEC will take justice 
and information. The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate. Hun Sen and Ranariddh are scheduled to meet 
Nov. 23 _ two days before parliament reopens _ to review the results 
of the working groups and give their final approval, Ahmad Yahya said. 
Their ability to repair their relationship and work together will 
be the key to a stable coalition. ``I consider this a remarriage,'' 
Ahmad Yahya said. ``They have to be careful with the way they work 
and what they say. They will have to compromise to achieve results.'' 
Ranariddh's ally, Sam Rainsy, whose party placed a distant third in 
the election, was left out of last week's deal. Sam Rainsy, a virulent 
critic of Hun Sen, and his party's 14 other members of parliament 
have remained outside Cambodia since September amid fears for their 
security. In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Monday, Sam 
Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament. Sam Rainsy said he had been told by Ranariddh that 
his party and former Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been implicated by 
Hun Sen in a rocket attack on the Sept. 24 opening of parliament. 
Authorities have called it an assassination attempt on Hun Sen. A 
police general investigating the attack said Monday that likely suspects 
have been identified, but he would not reveal names or their political 
affiliation. 
 
Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country. The assurances 
were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun 
Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices 
in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind 
a plot against his life. Sam Rainsy and the 14 members of parliament 
from his party have been holed up overseas for two months. But a deal 
reached between Hun Sen and his chief rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, 
on forming a new government last week has opened the door for their 
return. In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied 
to all politicians. His assurances come a week before the first session 
of Cambodia's new parliament, the National Assembly. Sam Rainsy said 
Wednesday that he was unsatisfied with the guarantee. He said it contained 
indirect language and loopholes that suggest he and his Sam Rainsy 
Party members are still under threat of arrest from Hun Sen's ruling 
party. ``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members 
of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' 
the opposition leader said in a statement. ``But instead they make 
roundabout statements, full of loopholes that can easily be exploited 
by a legal system that is completely in their control.'' Ranariddh 
told reporters Wednesday that he believed it was safe for Sam Rainsy 
in Cambodia. Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government. Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly. The deal assures 
the two-thirds vote in parliament needed to approve a new government. 
The men served as co-prime ministers until Hun Sen overthrew Ranariddh 
in a coup last year. ``I think Hun Sen has got everything. He's got 
the premiership and legitimacy through the election and recognition 
from his majesty the king. I don't think there is any benefit for 
Hun Sen to cause instability for our country,'' Ranariddh said. The 
prince also said that his top general, Nhek Bunchhay, would not be 
given back his previous position as the second-ranking general in 
the Cambodian military's general staff. Nhek Bunchhay's outnumbered 
forces in the capital put up tough but unsuccessful resistance to 
last year's coup. 
 
Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia. Hun 
Sen announced a government guarantee Wednesday of all politicians' 
safety and their right to conduct political activities ``in accordance 
with the laws in force.'' Sam Rainsy, who earlier called Hun Sen's 
statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election. Sam Rainsy, a staunch critic of Hun Sen, was 
forced to take refuge in a U.N. office in September to avoid arrest 
after Hun Sen accused him of being behind a plot against his life. 
The alleged assassination attempt came during massive street demonstrations 
organized by the opposition after Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party 
narrowly won the election. The opposition, alleging widespread fraud 
and intimidation, refused to accept the results of the polls. Fearing 
for their safety, Sam Rainsy and his then-ally Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
led an exodus of opposition lawmakers out of Cambodia after parliament 
was ceremonially opened in late September. Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government. The 
agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president 
of the National Assembly. The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament. Sok An, representing 
Hun Sen's party, said Friday that one working group had completed 
its work on a joint political platform to be implemented by the new 
government. The platform is said to emphasize administrative, economic 
and judicial reforms, but Sok An would not reveal details, saying 
Hun Sen would announce it when he presents his Cabinet choices to 
the National Assembly. 
 
King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's 
top two political parties _ previously bitter rivals _ to form a coalition 
government led by strongman Hun Sen. In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
``The protocol on cooperation between the CPP and FUNCINPEC will certainly 
bring peace and progress to our nation and people,'' Sihanouk wrote. 
Uncompromising enemies just a few months ago, Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC 
President Prince Norodom Ranariddh agreed Nov. 13 to form a government 
at a summit convened by Sihanouk. The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly. Sihanouk, recalling 
procedures used in a past government, suggested Tuesday that he should 
appoint the first two members of the upper house. The remaining senators, 
he said, should be selected by a method agreed upon by the new government 
and the National Assembly. Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly. Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties. 
","Prospects were dim for resolution of the political crisis in Cambodia in October 1998.
Prime Minister Hun Sen insisted that talks take place in Cambodia while opposition leaders Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, fearing arrest at home, wanted them abroad.
King Sihanouk declined to chair talks in either place.
A U.S. House resolution criticized Hun Sen's regime while the opposition tried to cut off his access to loans.
But in November the King announced a coalition government with Hun Sen heading the executive and Ranariddh leading the parliament.
Left out, Sam Rainsy sought the King's assurance of Hun Sen's promise of safety and freedom for all politicians.
