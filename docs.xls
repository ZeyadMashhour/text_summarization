Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Friday rejected opposition parties' demands 
for talks outside the country, accusing them of trying to ``internationalize'' 
the political crisis. Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed. Opposition leaders Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition 
figures after two alleged attempts on his life, said they could not 
negotiate freely in Cambodia and called for talks at Sihanouk's residence 
in Beijing. Hun Sen, however, rejected that. ``I would like to make 
it clear that all meetings related to Cambodian affairs must be conducted 
in the Kingdom of Cambodia,'' Hun Sen told reporters after a Cabinet 
meeting on Friday. ``No-one should internationalize Cambodian affairs. 
It is detrimental to the sovereignty of Cambodia,'' he said. Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in 
July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form 
a government on its own. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have charged that 
Hun Sen's victory in the elections was achieved through widespread 
fraud. They have demanded a thorough investigation into their election 
complaints as a precondition for their cooperation in getting the 
national assembly moving and a new government formed. Hun Sen said 
on Friday that the opposition concerns over their safety in the country 
was ``just an excuse for them to stay abroad.'' Both Ranariddh and 
Sam Rainsy have been outside the country since parliament was ceremonially 
opened on Sep. 24. Sam Rainsy and a number of opposition figures have 
been under court investigation for a grenade attack on Hun Sen's Phnom 
Penh residence on Sep. 7. Hun Sen was not home at the time of the 
attack, which was followed by a police crackdown on demonstrators 
contesting Hun Sen's election victory. The Sam Rainsy Party, in a 
statement released Friday, accused Hun Sen of being ``unwilling to 
make any compromise'' on negotiations to break the deadlock. ``A meeting 
outside Cambodia, as suggested by the opposition, could place all 
parties on more equal footing,'' said the statement. ``But the ruling 
party refuses to negotiate unless it is able to threaten its negotiating 
partners with arrest or worse.'' 
 
King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government. Cambodian leader 
Hun Sen's ruling party and the two-party opposition had called on 
the monarch to lead top-level talks, but disagreed on its location. 
``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party. A copy of the letter was obtained 
Thursday. In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.'' Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party. ``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability 
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised 
speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords. Hun 
Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national 
election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government 
on its own. Opposition parties led by Ranariddh and former finance 
minister Sam Ram Rainsy have refused to enter into a coalition with 
Hun Sen until their allegations of election fraud have been thoroughly 
investigated. International monitors said the election was relatively 
free and fair. Hun Sen said his current government would remain in 
power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one. Ranariddh 
and Sam Rainsy have remained outside the country since the Sept. 24 
ceremonial convening of parliament. Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest 
opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating 
inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence 
in Beijing. Hun Sen has rejected the opposition's reservations, saying 
it would be inappropriate to hold a summit outside the country. Negotiations 
so far have proved fruitless except for the opening of parliament 
after a Sept. 22 summit led by the king. Hun Sen implied Thursday 
that the opposition failed to follow through on promises made at the 
summit. ``If those results are strictly respected, there seems no 
reason to hold another summit,'' Hun Sen said in a speech on the anniversary 
of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords. Sihanouk is reportedly set to fly 
to Beijing next month to receive medical treatment from his Chinese 
doctors. The 75-year-old monarch suffers from a variety ailments and 
periodically makes extended trips to Beijing. He was diagnosed with 
colon cancer in 1993, but it has since gone into remission. In September, 
thousands of people filled the streets of Phnom Penh to protest against 
the alleged election fraud. Hun Sen ordered police to break up the 
demonstrations. At least four demonstrators were killed by police, 
but the discovery of more than 20 bodies in the aftermath has prompted 
speculation that the death tally could be much higher. In his speech, 
Hun Sen blamed the violence on opposition leaders, saying the demonstrations 
instigated social and economic chaos. 
 
Cambodia's two-party opposition asked the Asian Development Bank Monday 
to stop providing loans to the incumbent government, which it calls 
illegal. Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue. Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
Meanwhile, it says, the old government is holding power illegally. 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy renewed their international lobbying campaign 
against the old government Monday in a letter to ADB President Mitsuo 
Sato calling for the bank to stop lending money to it. ``We respectfully 
advise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loans to 
the current regime in Cambodia,'' the two party leaders wrote. ``At 
best the current regime could be considered a caretaker government 
as it has not been approved by the National Assembly.'' After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees. ``There have been 
reports that there is an attempt to internationalize the return of 
those members of parliament on the excuse of security problems,'' 
Prak Sokhonn said. ``Some (opposition politicians) have wanted the 
United Nations to help guarantee a safe return for them.'' The U.N. 
secretary-general's representative office in Phnom Penh provided monitors 
to opposition politicians after they returned to Cambodia to participate 
in the July election. The monitoring ended Sept. 30. ``Our office 
has not received any official request for that operation to be started 
up again,'' U.N. diplomat Jonathan Prentice said Monday in reaction 
to Prak Sokhonn's statement. The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, 
but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and 
recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. 
Diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled talks appeared to bear fruit 
Monday as Japanese Foreign Affairs Secretary of State Nobutaka Machimura 
said King Norodom Sihanouk has called on Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
to return to Cambodia. Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
Cambodia's ruling party responded Tuesday to criticisms of its leader 
in the U.S. Congress with a lengthy defense of strongman Hun Sen's 
human rights record. The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding 
resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives 
calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian 
law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution 
include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against 
anti-government demonstrations. A copy of the resolution has since 
been submitted to the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. 
``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement. It defended Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh 
as a proper response to the prince's attempts at the time to negotiate 
the defections of senior Khmer Rouge rebels. It also repeated claims 
that the prince's party had moved rebel soldiers into Phnom Penh, 
a contention that remains unproved. The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation. Ranariddh and his core supporters 
did not return to Cambodia until a few months before an election in 
July this year that the ruling party narrowly won. Ranariddh and his 
opposition ally, Sam Rainsy, refused to accept the election results, 
alleging widespread intimidation and fraud by the CPP. When their 
claims were dismissed by a Hun Sen-friendly court, they rallied their 
supporters into the streets of Phnom Penh. After two weeks of tolerating 
the demonstrations, Hun Sen ordered a violent crackdown that resulted 
in the deaths of at least four protesters. U.N. human rights workers 
later discovered more than 20 bodies _ many bearing signs of torture 
_ in and around the capital, prompting speculation that the death 
toll could be much higher. The ruling party supported the police action 
in its statement, noting that public property was damaged by protesters 
and that grenades were thrown at Hun Sen's home after Sam Rainsy suggested 
in a speech that the U.S. government should fire cruise missiles at 
Hun Sen. The opposition claims the grenade attack was staged as an 
excuse to begin the crackdown. ``The leaders of illegal demonstrations 
are the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving 
from the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly 
violence as ``minor incidents.'' The ruling party also reminded the 
United States that Washington supported a Cambodian exile government 
dominated by the brutal Khmer Rouge in the 1980s. The Khmer Rouge 
was responsible for the deaths of as many as 2 million people during 
the guerrilla group's 1975-79 rule of Cambodia. After a series of 
border clashes, the Khmer Rouge was ousted from power by an invading 
Vietnamese army that set up a surrogate Cambodian communist government 
later led by Hun Sen. The ruling party accused U.S. policy-makers 
of not taking timely action to save the Cambodian people from the 
Khmer Rouge. ``They must not make unjust accusations against those 
who led the struggle to liberate the people from genocide,'' it added. 
 
Cambodia's leading opposition party ruled out sharing the presidency 
of Parliament with its arch foe Saturday, insisting it alone must 
occupy the top position in the legislative body. Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government. Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse. The 
prince's party, in a statement dated Friday and seen Saturday, said 
such a scenario was unconstitutional. ``Co-sharing anything with the 
CPP means surrendering full power to them. Furthermore, such a proposal 
is unconstitutional,'' the faxed statement said. The royalist party 
also rejected Hun Sen's calls to hold bilateral talks, insisting that 
Ranariddh's main ally Sam Rainsy also be included. ``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions. Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post. In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Fearing arrest, many opposition members of Parliament left Cambodia 
after the ceremonial opening of the National Assembly on Sep. 24. 
A series of negotiations to forge a new government have failed. The 
talks have been complicated by the CPP-FUNCINPEC quarrel over the 
Parliament's top job. Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government. FUNCINPEC has demanded from Hun Sen written guarantees 
for the safety of its members and activities as a precondition for 
re-entering negotiations. 
 
Cambodia's bickering political parties broke a three-month deadlock 
Friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun 
Sen as sole prime minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced. In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party 
dropped insistence on a joint assembly chairmanship shared by Ranariddh 
and party boss Chea Sim, the current speaker. It was one of the main 
stumbling blocks in months of discord. Instead, Sihanouk announced, 
the constitution will be modified to create a new Senate, which Chea 
Sim will head. Chea Sim will still serve as acting head of state during 
the king's frequent absences from the country. ``The major political 
crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock 
facing the nation has also come to an end,'' the king said in his 
statement. The Senate will initially be appointed by the king. The 
agreement did not say how many seats there would be, nor how they 
would be divided. The parties will hammer out details later. Pok Than, 
one of Ranariddh's negotiators, said the Senate would serve a mostly 
advisory role to the assembly. The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies. The two parties 
said that the assembly would convene again Nov. 25. The agreement 
came surprisingly quickly following Ranariddh's return Thursday from 
Thailand, where he had been holed up with other opposition figures 
for weeks amid fears for their safety if they stayed in Cambodia. 
The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid. It could also hasten Cambodia's entry 
into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, put on hold last 
year after Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody 
coup. Earlier, as both sides arrived at the Royal Palace for a second 
day of meetings, Sihanouk said they had agreed in principle to form 
a coalition and made ``important concessions.'' The king, the sole 
force in Cambodian politics able to broker a deal, pressured both 
sides to reach agreement before he leaves Saturday for medical treatment 
in Beijing. Sihanouk reported that Hun Sen responded positively to 
a request by Ranariddh for five of his key supporters to receive political 
pardons. All five were convicted of political crimes by courts that 
are widely seen as loyal to Hun Sen. The king has powers to grant 
pardons, but has awaited agreement from Hun Sen in politically sensitive 
cases. Former battlefield enemies, the CPP and FUNCINPEC have been 
at loggerheads since the CPP narrowly won parliamentary elections 
in July. The vote failed to put an end to instability that followed 
last year's coup. The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to form a government alone. Ranariddh's party and opposition ally 
Sam Rainsy held back their support, claiming the CPP won due to fraud 
and intimidation. The opposition organized protests in Phnom Penh 
seeking Hun Sen's ouster that were violently dispersed. Sam Rainsy, 
under investigation by a Phnom Penh court for his role in the demonstrations, 
has remained abroad. His 15 seats in the 122-seat assembly are irrelevant 
to forming a working government. 
 
Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge. Their arguments turned bloody last year when Hun Sen 
ousted Ranariddh in a coup. The prince fled Cambodia and did not return 
until a few months before elections in July. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations. After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly. ``This will not be a repetition 
of 1993 because there will not be two prime ministers,'' said Hun 
Sen aide Prak Sokhon, who attended last week's summit. ``When we had 
two prime ministers, everything moved very slowly and decisions were 
made more politically than technically.'' Ranariddh said Saturday 
that the two parties agreed to keep the ministries of interior and 
defense under co-ministers. Senior FUNCINPEC official Ahmad Yahya 
revealed Monday that it was also agreed that the CPP would control 
the foreign affairs and finance portfolios. FUNCINPEC will take justice 
and information. The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate. Hun Sen and Ranariddh are scheduled to meet 
Nov. 23 _ two days before parliament reopens _ to review the results 
of the working groups and give their final approval, Ahmad Yahya said. 
Their ability to repair their relationship and work together will 
be the key to a stable coalition. ``I consider this a remarriage,'' 
Ahmad Yahya said. ``They have to be careful with the way they work 
and what they say. They will have to compromise to achieve results.'' 
Ranariddh's ally, Sam Rainsy, whose party placed a distant third in 
the election, was left out of last week's deal. Sam Rainsy, a virulent 
critic of Hun Sen, and his party's 14 other members of parliament 
have remained outside Cambodia since September amid fears for their 
security. In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Monday, Sam 
Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament. Sam Rainsy said he had been told by Ranariddh that 
his party and former Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been implicated by 
Hun Sen in a rocket attack on the Sept. 24 opening of parliament. 
Authorities have called it an assassination attempt on Hun Sen. A 
police general investigating the attack said Monday that likely suspects 
have been identified, but he would not reveal names or their political 
affiliation. 
 
Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country. The assurances 
were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun 
Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices 
in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind 
a plot against his life. Sam Rainsy and the 14 members of parliament 
from his party have been holed up overseas for two months. But a deal 
reached between Hun Sen and his chief rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, 
on forming a new government last week has opened the door for their 
return. In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied 
to all politicians. His assurances come a week before the first session 
of Cambodia's new parliament, the National Assembly. Sam Rainsy said 
Wednesday that he was unsatisfied with the guarantee. He said it contained 
indirect language and loopholes that suggest he and his Sam Rainsy 
Party members are still under threat of arrest from Hun Sen's ruling 
party. ``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members 
of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' 
the opposition leader said in a statement. ``But instead they make 
roundabout statements, full of loopholes that can easily be exploited 
by a legal system that is completely in their control.'' Ranariddh 
told reporters Wednesday that he believed it was safe for Sam Rainsy 
in Cambodia. Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government. Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly. The deal assures 
the two-thirds vote in parliament needed to approve a new government. 
The men served as co-prime ministers until Hun Sen overthrew Ranariddh 
in a coup last year. ``I think Hun Sen has got everything. He's got 
the premiership and legitimacy through the election and recognition 
from his majesty the king. I don't think there is any benefit for 
Hun Sen to cause instability for our country,'' Ranariddh said. The 
prince also said that his top general, Nhek Bunchhay, would not be 
given back his previous position as the second-ranking general in 
the Cambodian military's general staff. Nhek Bunchhay's outnumbered 
forces in the capital put up tough but unsuccessful resistance to 
last year's coup. 
 
Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia. Hun 
Sen announced a government guarantee Wednesday of all politicians' 
safety and their right to conduct political activities ``in accordance 
with the laws in force.'' Sam Rainsy, who earlier called Hun Sen's 
statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election. Sam Rainsy, a staunch critic of Hun Sen, was 
forced to take refuge in a U.N. office in September to avoid arrest 
after Hun Sen accused him of being behind a plot against his life. 
The alleged assassination attempt came during massive street demonstrations 
organized by the opposition after Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party 
narrowly won the election. The opposition, alleging widespread fraud 
and intimidation, refused to accept the results of the polls. Fearing 
for their safety, Sam Rainsy and his then-ally Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
led an exodus of opposition lawmakers out of Cambodia after parliament 
was ceremonially opened in late September. Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government. The 
agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president 
of the National Assembly. The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament. Sok An, representing 
Hun Sen's party, said Friday that one working group had completed 
its work on a joint political platform to be implemented by the new 
government. The platform is said to emphasize administrative, economic 
and judicial reforms, but Sok An would not reveal details, saying 
Hun Sen would announce it when he presents his Cabinet choices to 
the National Assembly. 
 
King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's 
top two political parties _ previously bitter rivals _ to form a coalition 
government led by strongman Hun Sen. In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
``The protocol on cooperation between the CPP and FUNCINPEC will certainly 
bring peace and progress to our nation and people,'' Sihanouk wrote. 
Uncompromising enemies just a few months ago, Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC 
President Prince Norodom Ranariddh agreed Nov. 13 to form a government 
at a summit convened by Sihanouk. The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly. Sihanouk, recalling 
procedures used in a past government, suggested Tuesday that he should 
appoint the first two members of the upper house. The remaining senators, 
he said, should be selected by a method agreed upon by the new government 
and the National Assembly. Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly. Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties. 
","Prospects were dim for resolution of the political crisis in Cambodia in October 1998.
Prime Minister Hun Sen insisted that talks take place in Cambodia while opposition leaders Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, fearing arrest at home, wanted them abroad.
King Sihanouk declined to chair talks in either place.
A U.S. House resolution criticized Hun Sen's regime while the opposition tried to cut off his access to loans.
But in November the King announced a coalition government with Hun Sen heading the executive and Ranariddh leading the parliament.
Left out, Sam Rainsy sought the King's assurance of Hun Sen's promise of safety and freedom for all politicians.

Honduras braced for potential catastrophe Tuesday as Hurricane Mitch 
roared through the northwest Caribbean, churning up high waves and 
intense rain that sent coastal residents scurrying for safer ground. 
President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of maximum alert 
and the Honduran military sent planes to pluck residents from their 
homes on islands near the coast. At 0900 GMT Tuesday, Mitch was 95 
miles (152 kilometers) north of Honduras, near the Swan Islands. With 
winds near 180 mph (289 kph), and even higher gusts, it was a Category 
5 monster _ the highest, most dangerous rating for a storm. The 350-mile 
(560-kilometer) wide hurricane was moving west at 8 mph (12 kph). 
``Mitch is closing in,'' said Monterrey Cardenas, mayor of Utila, 
an island 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the Honduran coast. ``And God 
help us.'' Mitch posed no immediate threat to the United States, forecasters 
said, but was expected to remain in the northwest Caribbean for five 
days. The U.S. National Weather Service in Miami said Mitch could 
weaken somewhat, but warned it would still remain ``a very dangerous 
hurricane capable of causing catastrophic damage.'' The entire coast 
of Honduras was under a hurricane warning and up to 15 inches (38 
centimeters) of rain was forecast in mountain areas. The Honduran 
president closed schools and public offices on the coast Monday and 
ordered all air force planes and helicopters to evacuate people from 
the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the country's 
central coast. The head of the Honduran armed forces, Gen. Mario Hung 
Pacheco, said 5,000 soldiers were standing by to help victims of the 
storm, but he warned the military could not reach everyone. ``For 
that humanitarian work, we would need more than 300 Hercules C-137 
planes,'' he said. ``Honduras doesn't have them.'' A hurricane warning 
was also in effect for the Caribbean coast of Guatemala. In Belize, 
a hurricane watch was in place and the government also closed schools 
and sent workers home early Monday. Panic buying stripped bread from 
the shelves of some stores and some gasoline stations ran dry. Coastal 
Belize City was hit so hard by Hurricane Hattie in 1961 that the country 
built a new capital inland at Belmopan. Mexico mobilized troops and 
emergency workers Monday on the east coast of the Yucatan peninsula, 
which was also under a hurricane watch, and Cuba said it had evacuated 
600 vacationers from the Island of Youth. Jerry Jarrell, the weather 
center director, said Mitch was the strongest hurricane to strike 
the Caribbean since 1988, when Gilbert killed more than 300 people. 
In La Ceiba, on Honduras' northern coast, people stood in long lines 
at filling stations Monday to buy gasoline under a steady rain. Maria 
Gonzalez said she needed the gas to cook with when her firewood gets 
wet. Still, she bought only 37 cents worth _ all she could afford. 
``I have six children, and we live in a riverbed,'' she said. ``If 
it gets really bad, we'll go to the church and see what the architect 
of the world has in store for us.'' Swinwick Jackson, a fisherman 
on Utila, had tied up his boats and was taking his family to stay 
with a relative on higher ground. National police spokesman Ivan Mejia 
said the Coco, Segovia and Cruta rivers all overflowed their banks 
Monday along Honduras' eastern coast. ``Frightened people are moving 
into the mountains to search for shelter,'' he said. In El Progreso, 
100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, 
the army evacuated more than 5,000 people who live in low-lying banana 
plantations along the Ulua River, said Nolly Soliman, a resident. 
Before bearing down on Honduras, Mitch swept past Jamaica and the 
Cayman Islands. Rain squalls flooded streets in the Jamaican capital, 
Kingston, and government offices and schools closed in the Caymans, 
a British colony of 28,000 people. The strongest hurricane to hit 
Honduras in recent memory was Fifi in 1974, which ravaged Honduras' 
Caribbean coast, killing at least 2,000 people. 
 
Hurricane Mitch paused in its whirl through the western Caribbean 
on Wednesday to punish Honduras with 120-mph (205-kph) winds, topping 
trees, sweeping away bridges, flooding neighborhoods and killing at 
least 32 people. Mitch was drifting west at only 2 mph (3 kph) over 
the Bay Islands, Honduras' most popular tourist area. It also was 
only 30 miles (50 kms) off the coast, and hurricane-force winds stretched 
outward 105 miles (165 kms); tropical storm-force winds 175 miles 
(280 kms). That meant the Honduran coast had been under hurricane 
conditions for more than a day. ``The hurricane has destroyed almost 
everything,'' said Mike Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island which 
was within miles (kms) of the eye of the hurricane. ``Few houses have 
remained standing.'' At its, 4th graf pvs 
 
Hurricane Mitch cut through the Honduran coast like a ripsaw Thursday, 
its devastating winds whirling for a third day through resort islands 
and mainland communities. At least 32 people were killed and widespread 
flooding prompted more than 150,000 to seek higher ground. Mitch, 
once among the century's most powerful hurricanes, weakened today 
as it blasted this Central American nation, bringing downpours that 
flooded at least 50 rivers. It also kicked up huge waves that pounded 
seaside communities. The storm's power was easing and by 1200 GMT, 
it had sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph), down from 100 mph (160 
kph) around midnight and well below its 180 mph (290 kph) peak of 
early Tuesday. After remaining virtually stationary for more than 
a day, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Thursday the center 
of the 350-mile-wide (560-kilometer-wide) storm had moved slightly 
to the south but remained just off the Honduran coast. Hurricane-force 
winds whirled up to 30 miles (50 kilometers) from the center, with 
rain-laden tropical storm winds extending well beyond that. Caught 
near the heart of the storm were the Bay Islands, about 25 miles (40 
kilometers) off Honduras' coast and popular with divers and beachcombers. 
``The hurricane has destroyed almost everything,'' said Mike Brown, 
a resident of Guanaja Island, 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the coast. 
``Few houses have remained standing.'' Honduran officials said 14 
people had died on that small island alone, and at least nine had 
died elsewhere in the country. More than 72,000 people had been evacuated 
to shelters. Nine other deaths had been reported elsewhere in the 
region by early Thursday _ more than a day after Mitch drifted to 
just off the coast and seemed to park there. An American was thrown 
from his boat south of Cancun, Mexico, on Monday and was presumed 
dead. Eight others died in Nicaragua in flooding. Honduran officials 
said more than 200 towns and villages had been isolated by the storm, 
left without power, telephones or clean drinking water. Agriculture 
Minister Pedro Arturo Sevilla said crucial grain, citrus and banana 
crops had been damaged ``and the economic future of Honduras is uncertain.'' 
Rain-swollen rivers knocked out bridges and roads, isolating La Ceiba, 
a coastal city of 40,000 people located 80 miles (128 kilometers) 
from the Bay Islands. About 10,000 residents fled to crowded shelters 
in schools, churches and firehouses. While supplies of food and gasoline 
seemed to hold up, drivers worried about the coming days formed long 
lines to fill their tanks at gas stations and some supermarkets took 
measures to limit panic buying. La Ceiba officials appealed for pure 
water for those in shelters and some residents set out plastic buckets 
to collect rainwater. Only a few hotels and offices with their own 
generators had electricity. Wind-whipped waves almost buried some 
houses near the shore. People evacuated low-lying houses by wading 
through chest-deep water with sodden bags of belongings on their heads. 
In neighboring Belize, most of the 75,000 residents of coastal Belize 
City had left by Wednesday, turning the country's largest city into 
a ghost town. Police and soldiers patrolled the streets, and a few 
people wandered amid the boarded-up houses. The cable television company 
was broadcasting only The Weather Channel. With the storm seemingly 
anchored off Honduras, officials in Mexico to the north eased emergency 
measures on the Caribbean coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, where hundreds 
of people remained in shelters as a precaution Wednesday night. More 
than 20,000 tourists had abandoned Cancun and nearby resort areas, 
leaving hotels at about 20 percent of capacity. Houston accountant 
Kathy Montgomery said that she and her friend Nina Devries had tried 
to leave Cancun but found all the flights full. ``It's been horrible,'' 
said Montgomery, as she and her friend drank cocktails at an outdoor 
restaurant. ``We couldn't go out on a boat, we couldn't go snorkeling. 
``Even Carlos' N Charlie's and Senor Frog's are closed,'' she said 
dejectedly, referring to two restaurants. ``Some vacation.'' The U.S. 
Agency for International Development sent two helicopters each to 
Belize and Honduras to help in search, rescue and relief efforts. 
At its peak, Mitch was the fourth-strongest Caribbean hurricane in 
this century, behind Gilbert in 1988, Allen in 1980 and the Labor 
Day hurricane of 1935. 
 
At least 231 people have been confirmed dead in Honduras from former-hurricane 
Mitch, bringing the storm's death toll in the region to 357, the National 
Emergency Commission said Saturday. Mitch _ once, 2nd graf pvs 
 
In Honduras, at least 231 deaths have been blamed on Mitch, the National 
Emergency Commission said Saturday. El Salvador _ where 140 people 
died in flash floods _ declared a state of emergency Saturday, as 
did Guatemala, where 21 people died when floods swept away their homes. 
Mexico reported one death from Mitch last Monday. In the Caribbean, 
the U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a tourist schooner with 
31 people aboard that hasn't been heard from since Tuesday. By late 
Sunday, Mitch's winds, once near 180 mph (290 kph), had dropped to 
near 30 mph (50 kph), and the storm _ now classified as a tropical 
depression _ was near Tapachula, on Mexico's southern Pacific coast 
near the Guatemalan border. Mitch was moving west at 8 mph (13 kph) 
and was dissipating but threatened to strengthen again if it moved 
back out to sea. 
 
Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said Sunday night that between 
1,000 and 1,500 people were buried in a 32-square mile (82.88 square-kilometer) 
area below the slopes of the Casita volcano in northern Nicaragua. 
That is in addition to least another 600 people elsewhere in the country, 
Bolanos said. 
 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Tuesday approved 6.4 
million European currency units (dlrs 7.7 million) in aid for thousands 
of victims of the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch in Central 
America. EU spokesman Pietro Petrucci said the funds will be used 
to provide basic care such as medicine, food, water sanitation and 
blankets to thousands of people whose homes were destroyed by torrential 
rains and mudslides. The aid will be distributed in Nicaragua, El 
Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala which have most suffered from Mitch's 
deadly passage, the EU executive Commission said in a statement. Officials 
in Central America estimated Tuesday that about 7,000 people have 
died in the region. The greatest losses were reported in Honduras, 
where an estimated 5,000 people died and 600,000 people _ 10 percent 
of the population _ were forced to flee their homes after last week's 
storm. El Salvador's National Emergency Committee listed 174 dead, 
96 missing and 27,000 homeless. But its own regional affiliate in 
San Miguel province reported 125 dead there alone. Guatemala reported 
100 storm-related deaths. The latest EU aid follows an initial 400,000 
ecu (dlrs 480,000). the EU approved for the region on Friday. The 
full 6.8 million ecu (dlrs 8.18 million) will be channeled through 
humanitarian groups working in the region. 
 
Pope John Paul II appealed for aid Wednesday for the Central American 
countries stricken by hurricane Mitch and said he feels close to the 
thousands who are suffering. Speaking during his general audience, 
the pope urged ``all public and private institutions and all men of 
good will'' to do all they can ``in this grave moment of destruction 
and death.'' Hurricane Mitch killed an estimated 9,000 people throughout 
Central America in a disaster of such proportions that relief agencies 
have been overwhelmed. Among those attending the audience were six 
Russian cosmonauts taking a special course in Italy. As a gift, they 
gave John Paul a spacesuit. 
 
Better information from Honduras' ravaged countryside enabled officials 
to lower the confirmed death toll from Hurricane Mitch from 7,000 
to about 6,100 on Thursday, but leaders insisted the need for help 
was growing. President Carlos Flores declared Hurricane Mitch had 
set back Honduras' development by 50 years. He urged the more than 
1.5 million Hondurans affected by the storm to help with the recovery 
effort. ``The county is semi-destroyed and awaits the maximum effort 
and most fervent and constant work of every one of its children,'' 
he said. In the capital, Tegucigalpa, Mexican rescue teams began searching 
for avalanche victims. Honduran doctors dispensed vaccinations to 
prevent disease outbreaks in shelters crammed with refugees. As of 
Thursday, Mitch had killed 6,076 people in Honduras _ down from officials' 
earlier estimate of 7,000. The numbers of missing dropped from an 
estimated 11,000 to 4,621, Government Minister Delmer Urbizo said. 
``We have more access to places affected by the storm,'' Urbizo explained. 
``Until now, we have had a short amount of time and few resources 
to get reliable information.'' In Nicaragua, around 2,000 people were 
killed, most of those swept away when a volcano crater lake collapsed 
a week ago. El Salvador reported 239 dead; Guatemala said 194 of its 
people had been killed. Six people died in southern Mexico and seven 
in Costa Rica. Aid groups and governments have called for other countries 
to send medicine, water, canned food, roofing materials and equipment 
to help deliver supplies. In Washington on Thursday, President Bill 
Clinton ordered dlrs 30 million in Defense Department equipment and 
services and dlrs 36 million in food, fuel and other aid be sent to 
Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. The White House also 
said Clinton was dispatching Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al 
Gore, to Central America on a mission to show the U.S. commitment 
to providing humanitarian relief. Hillary Rodham Clinton also will 
travel to the region, visiting Nicaragua and Honduras on Nov. 16. 
She later will stop in El Salvador and Guatemala before continuing 
on to Haiti and the Dominican Republic for a visit that had been canceled 
due to Hurricane Georges, which struck the Caribbean in October. Mitch, 
which sat off the Honduran coast for several days last week, destroyed 
scores of Central American communities before moving northwest. The 
weakened storm crossed southern Florida on Thursday, damaging mobile 
homes and buildings and injuring at least seven people. Countries 
overwhelmed by the storm's devastation have only just begun to calculate 
the damage. Honduran authorities still don't know how many shelters 
have been set up across the Central American country. Surveyors have 
yet to evaluate roughly 10 percent of the most affected areas _ the 
departments of Cortes, Atlantida, Colon and Yoro in the north, southern 
Choluteca and Valle, and the central department of Francisco Morazan, 
which includes the capital. Numbers still can vary wildly. The estimated 
number of homeless dropped from 580,000 to 569,000 Thursday. Mitch 
damaged or destroyed at least 90 bridges on major highways, including 
most spans on Highway 5, the main north-south route, officials said. 
Urbizo said Honduran officials hoped the scale of need in next-door 
Nicaragua wouldn't overshadow Honduras' plight. ``Our problem is that 
all of the country has been affected,'' he said. Thursday's relief 
operations paled in comparison to the scope of the disaster. A total 
of 14 helicopter relief missions were delivering aid to stricken towns, 
said Col. Roger Antonio Caceres of the government's Operation Mitch 
emergency response task force. ``We can manage with the number of 
aircraft we have because there is little to distribute,'' Caceres 
said. More help was on the way. Mexico was sending 700 tons of food, 
11 tons of medicine, at least 12 helicopters, four cargo planes and 
475 soldiers to help in relief operations. The United States committed 
19 Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters, two C-27 aircraft and one C-130 
cargo plane. France said it was sending 250 rescue workers to Central 
America, along with a ship loaded with construction material and equipment. 
The U.N. World Food Program said Thursday it was diverting ships, 
some already at sea, to rush their cargoes of donated food to Central 
America. It also was pulling food from warehouses at its base in Rome, 
probably for delivery by emergency relief flights, spokesman Trevor 
Rowe said. ``We're trying to move food as fast as possible to help 
people as soon as possible,'' Rowe said. Searches for the missing 
continued, and some decomposed bodies, once found, were being buried 
in common graves. About 100 victims had been buried around Tegucigalpa, 
Mayor Nahum Valladeres said. In the flood-ravaged Tegucigalpa neighborhood 
of Nueva Esperanza, Mexican military rescuers loaded search dogs on 
their backs and forded a muddy river to look for people believed buried 
in a 200-foot (60-meter) avalanche that occurred last Friday. Dozens 
of homes were swept into the river. ``This is the first place we've 
been'' with the dogs, Honduran army Maj. Freddy Diaz Celaya said. 
``From here we'll continue searching downriver.'' Concerned that crowded 
shelter conditions could produce outbreaks of hepatitis, respiratory 
infections and other ailments, the Health Ministry announced an inoculation 
campaign, especially for children. Doctors volunteering at a shelter 
housing 4,000 people at Tegucigalpa's Polytechnic Development Institute 
said they'd heard of the campaign but had yet to receive word or medicines 
from the Health Ministry. ``We have to vaccinate the children,'' said 
Dr. Mario Soto, who has treated at least 300 children at the shelter 
for diarrhea, conjunctivitis and bacterial infections. 
 
Aid workers struggled Friday to reach survivors of Hurricane Mitch, 
who are in danger of dying from starvation and disease in the wake 
of the storm that officials estimate killed more than 10,000 people. 
Foreign aid and pledges of assistance poured into Central America, 
but damage to roads and bridges reduced the amount of supplies reaching 
hundreds of isolated communities to a trickle: only as much as could 
be dropped from a helicopter, when the aircraft can get through. In 
the Aguan River Valley in northern Honduras, floodwaters have receded, 
leaving a carpet of mud over hundreds of acres (hectares). In many 
nearby villages, residents have gone days without potable water or 
food. A 7-month-old baby died in the village of Olvido after three 
days without food. Residents feared more children would die. ``The 
worst thing, the saddest thing, are the children. The children are 
suffering, even dying,'' said the Rev. Cecilio Escobar Gallindo, the 
parish priest. A score of cargo aircraft landed Thursday at the normally 
quiet Toncontin airport in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, delivering 
aid from Mexico, the United States, Japan and Argentina. Former U.S. 
President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, intended to visit Nicaragua 
on Friday to learn more about the hurricane's impact, The Carter Center 
in Atlanta announced. ``We hope this visit will help call attention 
to the suffering and humanitarian need this disaster has created,'' 
Carter said in a statement. U.S. President Bill Clinton requested 
a ``global relief effort'' to help Central America and boosted U.S. 
emergency aid to dlrs 70 million. Clinton is dispatching a delegation 
next week led by Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, to deliver 
some of the supplies destined for Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador 
and Guatemala. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton added Nicaragua and 
Honduras to a trip she plans to the region beginning Nov. 16. Taiwan 
said today it will donate dlrs 2.6 million in relief to Honduras, 
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. The four countries are among 
a dwindling number of nations that recognize Taiwan, which China claims 
is a breakaway province. Two British ships that were in the area on 
an exercise were on their way to Honduras to join relief efforts, 
the Defense Ministry said Friday. ``It's a coincidence that the ships 
are there but they've got men and equipment that can be put to work 
in an organized way,'' said International Development Secretary Clare 
Short. Nicaragua said Friday it will accept Cuba's offer to send doctors 
as long as the communist nation flies them in on its own helicopters 
and with their own supplies. Nicaraguan leaders previously had refused 
Cuba's offer of medical help, saying it did not have the means to 
transport or support the doctors. Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistas, 
who maintained close relations with Fidel Castro during their 1979-90 
rule, had criticized the refusal by President Arnoldo Aleman's administration. 
","Hurricane Mitch approached Honduras on Oct. 27, 1998 with winds up to 180mph a Category 5 storm.
It hit the Honduran coast on Oct. 28 bringing downpours that forced large-scale evacuations.
On Nov. 1 Nicaragua announced collapse of a drenched volcano crater killing about 2,000.
By then Mitch's winds were down to 30mph, but as disaster reports poured in the death toll finally exceeded 10,000 and half a million left homeless.
The European Union, international relief agencies, Mexico, the U.S., Japan, Taiwan, the U.K. and U.N. sent financial aid, relief workers and supplies.
Pope John Paul II appealed to ""all public and private institutions"" to help.

where an estimated 5,000 people died and 600,000 people _ 10 percent 
of the population _ were forced to flee their homes after last week's 
storm.The Honduran 
president closed schools and public offices on the coast Monday and 
ordered all air force planes and helicopters to evacuate people from 
the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the country's 
central coast.Nine other deaths had been reported elsewhere in the 
region by early Thursday _ more than a day after Mitch drifted to 
just off the coast and seemed to park there.The head of the Honduran armed forces, Gen. Mario Hung 
Pacheco, said 5,000 soldiers were standing by to help victims of the 
storm, but he warned the military could not reach everyone.","After remaining virtually stationary for more than 
a day, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Thursday the center

to the south but remained just off the Honduran coast.By late 
Sunday, Mitch's winds, once near 180 mph (290 kph), had dropped to 
near 30 mph (50 kph), and the storm _ now classified as a tropical 
depression _ was near Tapachula, on Mexico's southern Pacific coast 
near the Guatemalan border.``The hurricane has destroyed almost everything,'' said Mike Brown, 
a resident of Guanaja Island, 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the coast.

Cuban President Fidel Castro said Sunday he disagreed with the arrest 
in London of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, calling it 
a case of ``international meddling.'' ``It seems to me that what has 
happened there (in London) is universal meddling,'' Castro told reporters 
covering the Ibero-American summit being held here Sunday. Castro 
had just finished breakfast with King Juan Carlos of Spain in a city 
hotel. He said the case seemed to be ``unprecedented and unusual.'' 
Pinochet, 82, was placed under arrest in London Friday by British 
police acting on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge. The judge is 
probing Pinochet's role in the death of Spaniards in Chile under his 
rule in the 1970s and 80s. The Chilean government has protested Pinochet's 
arrest, insisting that as a senator he was traveling on a diplomatic 
passport and had immunity from arrest. Castro, Latin America's only 
remaining authoritarian leader, said he lacked details on the case 
against Pinochet, but said he thought it placed the government of 
Chile and President Eduardo Frei in an uncomfortable position while 
Frei is attending the summit. Castro compared the action with the 
establishment in Rome in August of an International Criminal Court, 
a move Cuba has expressed reservations about. Castro said the court 
ought to be independent of the U.N. Security Council, because ``we 
already know who commands there,'' an apparent reference to the United 
States. The United States was one of only seven countries that voted 
against creating the court. ``The (Pinochet) case is serious ... the 
problem is delicate'' and the reactions of the Chilean Parliament 
and armed forces bear watching, Castro said. He expressed surprise 
that the British had arrested Pinochet, especially since he had provided 
support to England during its 1982 war with Argentina over the Falkland 
Islands. Although Chile maintained neutrality during the war, it was 
accused of providing military intelligence to the British. Castro 
joked that he would have thought police could have waited another 
24 hours to avoid having the arrest of Pinochet overshadow the summit 
being held here. ``Now they are talking about the arrest of Pinochet 
instead of the summit,'' he said. Pinochet left government in 1990, 
but remained as army chief until March when he became a senator-for-life. 
 
Britain has defended its arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, with one 
lawmaker saying that Chile's claim that the former Chilean dictator 
has diplomatic immunity is ridiculous. Chilean officials, meanwhile, 
issued strong protests and sent a delegation to London on Sunday to 
argue for Pinochet's release. The former strongman's son vowed to 
hire top attorneys to defend his 82-year-old father, who ruled Chile 
with an iron fist for 17 years. British police arrested Pinochet in 
his bed Friday at a private London hospital in response to a request 
from Spain, which wants to question Pinochet about allegations of 
murder during the decade after he seized power in 1973. Pinochet had 
gone to the hospital to have a back operation Oct. 9. ``The idea that 
such a brutal dictator as Pinochet should be claiming diplomatic immunity 
I think for most people in this country would be pretty gut-wrenching 
stuff,'' Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson said in a British Broadcasting 
Corp. television interview Sunday. Home Office Minister Alun Michael 
acknowledged Sunday that Pinochet entered Britain on a diplomatic 
passport, but said, ``That does not necessarily convey diplomatic 
immunity.'' The Foreign Office said only government officials visiting 
on official business and accredited diplomats have immunity. Pinochet 
has been a regular visitor to Britain, generally without publicity. 
His arrest this time appeared to reflect a tougher attitude toward 
right-wing dictators by Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party government, 
which replaced a Conservative Party administration 18 months ago and 
promised an ``ethical'' foreign policy. However, Michael Howard, a 
Conservative spokesman and former Cabinet minister, said he was concerned 
that Pinochet was arrested as a result of pressure from Labor lawmakers 
and lobby groups. Chilean President Eduardo Frei criticized the arrest, 
saying the Spanish magistrate's arrest order was tantamount to not 
recognizing Chile's institutions. ``Spain also lived under an authoritarian 
for 40 years and many of its present institutions are inherited from 
that regime,'' Frei said in Porto, Portugal, where he was attending 
the Ibero-American Summit. ``Would a Chilean court be allowed to start 
a trial for abuses that occurred under the Spanish authoritarian regime 
(of Francisco Franco)?'' Frei asked. ``It is only for Chilean courts 
to try events that occurred in Chile.'' Franco's reign ended in 1975. 
Pinochet's family issued a statement Sunday calling the arrest ``an 
insult'' and thanking the Chilean government, rightist politicians 
and the military for their support. In London, police guards were 
deployed Sunday outside the London Clinic, where Pinochet is believed 
to still be a patient. About 100 Chilean demonstrators pleased with 
the arrest gathered outside, chanting and waving placards bearing 
faded black and white portraits with the caption ``Disappeared in 
Chile.'' Across the Atlantic, the Chilean capital of Santiago was 
the scene of dueling demonstrations Sunday, reflecting the long-standing 
division of public opinion over Pinochet. The rallies were mostly 
peaceful, although riot police used tear gas and water cannons on 
some pro-Pinochet protesters trying to break through police lines 
into the British embassy on Sunday evening. No arrests or injuries 
were reported. The envoy sent to London to argue for Pinochet's release, 
Santiago Benadava, would offer only diplomatic advice, said Chilean 
Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza. Any legal defense would be up 
to Pinochet's family. Pinochet's son, Augusto, said the family would 
hire ``the best legal team available in London.'' Several right-wing 
Chilean politicians, including some who held posts in the Pinochet 
regime, also were flying to London to show their support to their 
former boss. Under extradition laws, Spain has 40 days from last Friday 
to formally apply for extradition. The final decision lies with British 
Home Secretary Jack Straw. There was no immediate word on when Pinochet 
would be questioned. But police sources, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said questioning was not expected for a week or two. Pinochet 
has been widely accused of running a ruthless regime marked by disappearances 
and deaths of political opponents. His arrest was prompted by applications 
last week to question him by two Spanish judges investigating human 
rights violations. One of them, Baltasar Garzon, also wants to question 
Pinochet about the disappearances of Chilean dissidents in Argentina. 
The arrest warrant, however, referred only to questioning about allegations 
that he killed Spaniards in Chile between 1973 and 1983. In Chile, 
seven Spaniards have been identified as missing or dead under the 
Pinochet regime, including two Catholic priests and a U.N. official. 
According to a Chilean government report, a total of 4,299 political 
opponents died or disappeared during Pinochet's term. Pinochet, commander-in-chief 
of the Chilean army until March, has immunity from prosecution in 
Chile as a senator-for-life under a new constitution that his government 
crafted. He is also covered under an amnesty for crimes committed 
before 1978 _ when most of the human rights abuses took place. 
 
Margaret Thatcher entertained former Children dictator Gen. Augusto 
Pinochet at her home two weeks before he was arrested in his bed in 
a London hospital, the ex-prime minister's office said Tuesday, amid 
growing diplomatic and domestic controversy over the move. Pinochet, 
who has vowed to fight attempts to extradite him to Spain on allegations 
of murder, genocide and torture, had drinks with Lady Thatcher and 
her husband, Denis, in their home in London's elite Belgravia district 
four days before he was hospitalized for back surgery performed Oct. 
9. ``She regarded it as a private meeting,'' said Mark Worthington, 
spokesman for the Lady Thatcher, Conservative Party prime minister 
from 1979-90. The 82-year-old Pinochet was arrested Friday at a Spanish 
magistrate's request. In Conservative government days, Pinochet was 
welcomed on regular visits that included tea with the prime minister. 
He was the only Latin American leader to support Britain in its 1982 
war against Argentina to reclaim the Falkland Islands. Pinochet and 
Lady Thatcher also implemented similar brands of right-wing economics. 
The current visit is Pincohet's first since Prime Minister Tony Blair's 
Labor Party administration was elected 18 months ago, ending 18 years 
of Conservative Party rule. Chile's ambassador delivered a formal 
protest to the Foreign Office on Monday, saying Britain has violated 
Pinochet's diplomatic immunity. He arrived last month on a diplomatic 
passport and is also a senator-for-life in Chile, which protects him 
from prosecution there. Pinochet's 17-year-rule was marked by torture 
and other human rights abuses against political opponents in which, 
the Chilean government has said, 4,299 people were killed or vanished. 
He remained Chilean army commander-in-chief until March. The magistrate 
broadened his charges Monday to include killings of Chileans as well 
as Spaniards, and genocide _ for which there is no diplomatic immunity. 
Chilean Ambassador Mario Artaza, himself an exile during Pinochet's 
rule, said Chile had a duty to protect a citizen with diplomatic immunity 
and senator status. ``We are not protecting the dictator of the '70s,'' 
Artaza said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview Tuesday. 
``What we are fighting for and discussing with the (British) government 
is the special situation of a senator in our transition who many people 
do not understand and many people don't like.'' ``We're not discussing 
his record during his period of dictatorship, that the present government 
does not support at all,'' added the ambassador. A Chilean specialist 
in international law was traveling to London for further meetings 
with British officials, Artaza said. Pinochet, expected to be hospitalized 
for perhaps two more weeks faces a long battle through British courts 
to avoid extradition, questioning by two Spanish judges who instigated 
the proceedings, and an appearance at London's Bow Street magistrate's 
court. British Conservative Party lawmakers accuse the Labor government 
of ``gesture'' politics and pandering to the party's left-wing. 
 
The Spanish and British governments appeared Wednesday to be seeking 
shelter from the political storm brewing over the possible extradition 
of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain. ``Despite everything 
that has been written, this is not a decision for the British government 
or the Spanish government,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said 
in an interview published by a Spanish newspaper on Wednesday. In 
a similar vein, Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman Joaquin Perez said 
Wednesday: ``The government should not have any opinion about the 
extradition.'' British police, acting on an international arrest warrant 
from Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon on Friday, detained the ailing 
general in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery. 
The detention and the possible extradition of Pinochet to Spain to 
stand trial for genocide, terrorism and torture during his 17-year 
dictatorship was warmly welcomed by human rights activists worldwide. 
But it sparked protests from the Chilean government, and fears it 
could damage economic relations. In 1997, seven years after Pinochet 
left power, Spain was the biggest single investor in Chile, followed 
closely by Britain. Blair quoted in the El Mundo newspaper said that 
Pinochet's detention was unrelated to his government's so-called Ethical 
Foreign Policy, apparently ignoring pressure from leftists within 
his Labor party to support moves to prosecute the former dictator. 
``This is about two legal systems united by an extradition treaty 
but nobody seems to understand this,'' he said. Blair added that should 
Home Secretary Jack Straw would use only strictly legal criteria and 
act ``as if he were a judge,'' should he be required to make a decision 
on an extradition request from Spain. The tone of the British Prime 
Minister's first public comment on the issue contrasted sharply with 
Sunday's emotional statement from influential Trade Secretary Peter 
Mandelson who said most Britons would find diplomatic immunity for 
Pinochet ``gut-wrenching.'' The European extradition convention gives 
Garzon 40 days to present a formal extradition request to the British 
authorities via the Spanish government. But while Spanish Prime Minister 
Jose Maria Aznar has promised his government would rubber stamp the 
process if it reaches his desk, he appears to be hoping he will never 
have to do so. Public prosecutors from Spain's National Court have 
appealed the judicial investigations into human rights abuses in Chile 
and Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest warrant. ``Depending on 
the result of the appeals it is possible that it (the extradition 
request) will never reach the government so perhaps the government 
will never have to pronounce on it,'' Aznar was quoted as saying in 
Wednesday's edition of the Madrid newspaper El Pais. The appeals argue 
that crimes committed during Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship are 
none of Spain's business, and should be left to the Chilean or international 
courts. A ruling on the appeals is expected next week, and a decision 
in their favor would nullify Garzon's extradition attempt. 
 
A delegation of Chilean legislators lobbying against the possible 
extradition of Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial, warned Thursday 
that Chile was on the brink of political turmoil. ``There is a climate 
of division, confrontation and instability in Chile,'' parliamentary 
deputy Alberto Espina told reporters in Madrid after meeting the Chilean 
ambassador. Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 at the instigation 
of Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon who is seeking to extradite 
the former dictator on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. 
In Chile, the detention triggered both celebrations by relatives of 
victims of Pinochet's 1973-1990 regime and protests from the retired 
general's supporters. Espina also warned that the issue was damaging 
relations between Chile Spain and Britain. Spain was the biggest single 
investor in Chile last year, followed closely by Britain. The deputy 
arrived in Madrid late Wednesday accompanied by the senators Jovino 
Movoa and Julio Lagos. The delegation is an offshoot of a larger group 
of Chilean parliamentarians currently protesting the detention in 
London on behalf of the opposition parties Independent Democratic 
Union and the National Renovation Party. Espina, Movoa and Lagos were 
hoping to talk to officials from the Spanish Foreign Ministry and 
other government representatives. ``All we ask is that Spain stops 
meddling in our internal affairs,'' Espina said, arguing that Chilean 
problems should be dealt with by Chilean courts. ``We stopped being 
a Spanish colony 188 years ago and we have no intention of becoming 
one again,'' he added. Government spokesman Josep Pique said Prime 
Minister Jose Maria Aznar had no plans to meet the delegation, the 
state-owned news agency EFE reported. Aznar has promised his government 
will rubber stamp a formal extradition request to the British government 
if asked to do so by the judicial authorities. But the extradition 
attempt could be annulled by legal challenges in Spain well before 
the deadline for presenting it in Britain. The deadline is set for 
November 25th _ coincidentally Pinochet's 83rd birthday. On Thursday 
the head prosecutor from the National Court set in motion appeals 
against several rulings made by Judge Garzon related to Pinochet's 
detention in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery. 
The court's plenary is expected to meet next week to decide on an 
earlier challenge of the Spanish judicial investigations into human 
rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest 
warrant. A ruling that the investigations are outside the jurisdiction 
of Spanish law would made any extradition request difficult. The decision 
is likely to hang on how genocide and terrorism are interpreted, as 
these crimes are specifically mentioned in the Spanish legal code. 
 
Europe's top official said Friday that he hoped former Chilean dictator 
Augusto Pinochet would be extradited to Spain to be tried for crimes 
committed during his 17-year rule. ``Sometimes it should be made clear 
that crimes, wherever they take place, cannot be left unpunished,'' 
European Commission President Jacques Santer said. Pinochet was detained 
by British police in London on Oct. 16 by request of a Spanish magistrate 
as a first step toward his extradition to stand trial for genocide 
and terrorism. ``The dictatorship caused great suffering and sent 
many citizens into exile,'' Santer said, referring to the 1973-90 
Pinochet regime. Santer was speaking to reporters in the northern 
Spanish city of Oviedo where he was due to receive the Prince of Asturias 
Prize for social science _ one of the eight annual prizes named after 
the heir to the Spanish throne. Meanwhile, a Spanish newspaper reported 
Friday that Pinochet is not fully aware of his predicament. Daily 
El Mundo said the ailing retired general's family and aides have been 
shielding him from the details for fear he would fly into a rage that 
would kill him. Pinochet was detained in the London clinic while recovering 
from back surgery. El Mundo said its reporter accompanied Chilean 
politicians seeking his release during a visit to the clinic Thursday. 
The reporter said he talked briefly to Pinochet's wife, Lucia Hiriart, 
and daughter Veronica. ``If Augusto knew the truth, he would have 
an attack of rage and die,'' El Mundo quoted Hiriart as saying to 
others while waiting for permission from Scotland Yard to visit her 
husband on the eighth floor of the clinic. She said she was particularly 
concerned because he is also suffering from a urinary infection, heart 
problems and diabetes, the newspaper reported. El Mundo reported that 
the family had asked police guards to stand outside the former dictator's 
room and keep out of sight. The paper said the room lacked television, 
radio or telephone. According to the report Pinochet was informed 
of the arrest order from two policemen, but is convinced it was a 
mistake and that he is protected by diplomatic immunity. Meanwhile, 
a Chilean television station reported Friday that a Chilean army officer 
close to Pinochet told the former military chief about his situation 
after flying to London Thursday. TV13 reported that the unidentified 
officer said Pinochet reacted calmly to the news imparted ``as one 
soldier to another.'' 
 
The wife of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet appealed for 
his release, saying he is too sick to be extradited to Spain to face 
charges of genocide. ''This is very painful for our family,'' a tearful 
Lucia Pinochet told reporters late Friday outside the private London 
Clinic, where her husband is under arrest as he recuperates from back 
surgery. 'I would like to ask for compassion for a person who is very, 
very, very, ill.'' Pinochet, 82, had surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated 
disc, a painful spinal disorder which had hindered his movement. He 
was arrested Oct. 16 at the instigation of a Spanish magistrate seeking 
to extradite him on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. The 
Spanish warrant cited 94 victims, but could be broadened to include 
some 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared during his 17-year-rule. 
Chile argues that Pinochet must be released because as a senator he 
enjoys diplomatic immunity _ and because he is in poor health. Unconfirmed 
media reports in Chile this week indicated that Pinochet, who has 
worn a pacemaker for years and is diabetic, also has a urinary tract 
infection. There have also been reports that he is suffering from 
depression. In a separate attempt to block his extradition, lawyers 
for the former strongman went to court Friday to argue that British 
police acted illegally in accepting the Spanish warrant. The case 
resumes Monday. Pinochet ruled from 1973 until 1990 but remained army 
commander until last March. Then, he moved to congress as a senator 
for life, as permitted by the constitution his regime drafted. 
 
The British and Spanish prime ministers said Sunday that the fate 
of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet is in the hands of 
their judicial authorities and they will not interfere. ``Both myself 
and Mr. Aznar agree this is not a matter for us to discuss,'' British 
Prime Minister Tony Blair said, referring to Spanish leader Jose Maria 
Aznar. ``I've avoided commenting on that judicial process and I don't 
intend to do so.'' Aznar made similar comments when he meet journalists 
on the margin of a European Union summit in this Alpine lakeside resort. 
Pinochet is under arrest in a London hospital where he'd gone for 
back surgery. He was detained on a warrant from a Spanish magistrate 
seeking to extradite him on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture 
during his 1973-90 rule. The Chilean government has urged Britain 
to release Pinochet on humanitarian grounds, and argued that as a 
senator, he is entitled to diplomatic immunity. Aznar dismissed reports 
that the bid to try Pinochet will damage Spain's relations with Latin 
America. ``It's important we don't talk nonsense about this issue. 
This is stupid.'' 
 
The Swiss government has ordered no investigation of possible bank 
accounts belonging to former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, a 
spokesman said Wednesday. Weekend newspaper reports in Spain said 
a Spanish judge who ordered Pinochet's arrest has issued a petition 
aimed at freezing any accounts the 82-year-old general might have 
in Luxembourg and Switzerland. But government spokesman Achille Casanova 
said no accounts have so far been frozen in Switzerland and no investigation 
order has been given to federal banking authorities. Pinochet has 
been held at a London clinic since his arrest earlier this month. 
Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon is seeking his extradition on charges 
of genocide, torture and terrorism during his 17-year rule which ended 
1990. On Monday, Switzerland also requested Pinochet's arrest and 
extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture. The move 
followed a criminal complaint filed in Geneva last week by the widow 
of Alexis Jaccard, a student of Swiss-Chilean dual nationality who 
disappeared in May 1977. Swiss authorities said the Spanish effort 
to extradite Pinochet should be given priority. A Spanish request 
for legal assistance from Switzerland, made Friday, has been passed 
on to Geneva authorities. No details have been given of the content 
of the Spanish request. 
 
As his lawyers in London tried to quash a Spanish arrest warrant for 
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, efforts began 
in Geneva and Paris to have him extradited. In London, where Pinochet 
has been under arrest in a clinic for the last 10 days, a phalanx 
of British lawyers argued before the High Court of Justice that the 
arrest order sent from Spain was illegal because the general, 82, 
is not a Spanish citizen. They also maintained that as a former head 
of state, the general had diplomatic immunity for actions taken while 
in office. His lawyer, Clive Nicholls, said that if a bid to extradite 
the general succeeded, by the same token Queen Elizabeth II could 
be extradited to Argentina to face trial for the death of Argentine 
soldiers in the Falklands war in 1982. On the opposing side, Alun 
Jones, a British government lawyer acting as prosecutor in the case, 
defended the Spanish warrant, which led to the general's detention 
in London. The prosecutor argued that the the right-wing general was 
responsible for killing at least 4,000 people and had set out ``to 
destroy a national group _ Chilean nationals who did not share his 
ideological values.'' After hearing the arguments in a court crowded 
with Chilean exiles in the public gallery, Lord Bingham, Britain's 
senior judge, said the court was expected to decide the matter on 
Tuesday. The Chilean air force has sent an ambulance plane to Britain 
in hope of the general's early release. But efforts to prevent that 
gathered strength elsewhere in Europe. In Geneva, a public prosecutor, 
Bernard Bertossa, said Monday that he had issued a warrant for Pinochet's 
arrest in connection with the kidnapping and presumed death of a Swiss-Chilean 
citizen in 1977. Bertossa said he had opened a judicial investigation 
in response to a complaint by the widow of the victim, Alexei Jaccard, 
who was 25 when he was tortured in Chile and subsequently disappeared. 
The prosecutor said he was asking the Swiss federal government to 
seek Pinochet's extradition from Britain to face trial in Geneva. 
At the same time in Paris Monday, the families of three French citizens, 
of whom two disappeared and one was killed in Chile during the 1973-90 
dictatorship, filed suit in a French court. In addition, a human rights 
group in Paris said Monday that it had filed a suit with a Paris court 
on behalf of Anne Marie Pesle, whose father, Etienne Pesle, disappeared 
in Chile in 1973. In Madrid, Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish investigating 
magistrate who first obtained Pinochet's arrest in London, said he 
had formally requested the governments of Switzerland and Luxemburg 
to block bank accounts held by the general. Court officials in Madrid 
said Garzon wanted any accounts blocked with a view to their possible 
use later as compensation to relatives of victims. In London, British 
officials keep insisting that Pinochet's case will be decided by the 
courts and not politically, yet the issue has stirred intense political 
activity both in Britain and in Chile. Supporters and opponents of 
the dictator have traveled to the London clinic where he is being 
held. From Chile have come six right-wing senators, the deputy foreign 
minister, aides and legal experts who file in and out of the private 
clinic in central London. From Europe have come dozens of longtime 
opponents of the general who were forced into exile after his 1973 
coup against the elected Socialist president, Salvador Allende Gossens. 
The exiles, along with others, stand daily outside the clinic holding 
up photographs of missing relatives and shouting anti-Pinochet slogans. 
On occasion there have been shouting matches between the two sides. 
``He is ill, and in a few days he will be 83,'' Mariano Fernandez, 
Chile's deputy foreign minister, said after visiting Pinochet who 
had minor surgery for a back ailment. After his surgery on Oct. 9, 
the general was arrested by Scotland Yard during the night of Oct. 
16. The diplomatic and judicial entanglements that ensued now involve 
at least five governments. The political and legal imbroglio could 
end if Britain's home secretary, Jack Straw, decides that the general 
should be released on ``compassionate grounds'' because of his age 
and failing health. Last week he said that in exercising his powers 
under the 1989 Extradition Act, he would consider whether the offenses 
are of a ``political character'' and he would take into account ``any 
compassionate circumstances.'' 
","Britain caused international controversy and Chilean turmoil by arresting former Chilean dictator Pinochet in London for Spain's investigation of Spanish citizen deaths under Pinochet's 17-year rule of torture and political murder.
Claims are Pinochet had diplomatic immunity, extradition is international meddling or illegal because Pinochet is not a Spanish citizen, also his crimes should be punished.
Spain and Britain, big Chilean investors, fear damage to economic relations and let courts decide extradition.
The Swiss haven't investigated Pinochet accounts despite a Spanish request.
Pinochet is shielded from details, said too sick to be extradited.

request) will never reach the government so perhaps the government 
will never have to pronounce on it,'' Aznar was quoted as saying in 
Wednesday's edition of the Madrid newspaper El Pais.His lawyer, Clive Nicholls, said that if a bid to extradite

was arrested Oct. 16 at the instigation of a Spanish magistrate seeking 
to extradite him on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture.He was detained on a warrant from a Spanish magistrate 
seeking to extradite him on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture 
during his 1973-90 rule.Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon is seeking his extradition on charges 
of genocide, torture and terrorism during his 17-year rule which ended 
1990.British police, acting on an international arrest warrant 
from Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon on Friday, detained the ailing 
general in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery. 
The 82-year-old Pinochet was arrested Friday at a Spanish 
magistrate's request.The detention and the possible extradition of Pinochet to Spain to 
stand trial for genocide, terrorism and torture during his 17-year 
dictatorship was warmly welcomed by human rights activists worldwide. 
","``The idea that 
such a brutal dictator as Pinochet should be claiming diplomatic immunity 
I think for most people in this country would be pretty gut-wrenching 
stuff,'' Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson said in a British Broadcasting 
Corp. television interview Sunday.In London, where Pinochet 
has been under arrest in a clinic for the last 10 days, a phalanx 
of British lawyers argued before the High Court of Justice that the 
arrest order sent from Spain was illegal because the general, 82, 
is not a Spanish citizen.Weekend newspaper reports in Spain said 
a Spanish judge who ordered Pinochet's arrest has issued a petition 
aimed at freezing any accounts the 82-year-old general might have 
in Luxembourg and Switzerland.Castro, Latin America's only 
remaining authoritarian leader, said he lacked details on the case 
against Pinochet, but said he thought it placed the government of 
Chile and President Eduardo Frei in an uncomfortable position while 
Frei is attending the summit.His lawyer, Clive Nicholls, said that if a bid to extradite 
the general succeeded, by the same token Queen Elizabeth II could 
be extradited to Argentina to face trial for the death of Argentine 
soldiers in the Falklands war in 1982.``Depending on 
the result of the appeals it is possible that it (the extradition 
request) will never reach the government so perhaps the government 
will never have to pronounce on it,'' Aznar was quoted as saying in 
Wednesday's edition of the Madrid newspaper El Pais.The tone of the British Prime 
Minister's first public comment on the issue contrasted sharply with 
Sunday's emotional statement from influential Trade Secretary Peter 
Mandelson who said most Britons would find diplomatic immunity for 
Pinochet ``gut-wrenching.''","In London, where Pinochet

MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ U.S. prosecutors have asked for a 20-day extension 
to provide Germany with paperwork necessary to extradite a top lieutenant 
of Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden, officials said Saturday. 
Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, 40, of Sudan, has been jailed since his arrest 
near Munich on Sept. 16 by Bavarian authorities acting on a U.S. warrant. 
Under German law, U.S. officials have 40 days after the arrest to 
turn over supporting evidence so a German court can rule on their 
extradition request. A Bavarian Justice Ministry spokesman, Gerhard 
Zierl, said U.S. authorities a few days ago asked the court hearing 
the case for an extra 20 days to provide the necessary material. Quoting 
unidentified Bavarian law enforcement sources, Focus newsmagazine 
reported Saturday that the evidence turned over so far was not very 
strong. The magazine said much of it was based on the testimony of 
an FBI informant, a former bin Laden associate, who made only vague 
connections between Salim and terrorist activities. Zierl declined 
to comment on the report, but said U.S. authorities probably asked 
for more time just a precautionary measure. U.S. authorities charge 
Salim helped finance, train and arm members of a terrorist organization, 
including the alleged bombers of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 
A criminal complaint unsealed Sept. 25 in U.S. District Court in New 
York charges him with murder conspiracy and use of weapons of mass 
destruction. 
 
The Taliban's chief justice accused the United States on Wednesday 
of looking for an ``excuse'' to launch another missile attack on his 
war-shattered homeland. And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, the man 
Washington calls Enemy No. 1 and blames for the Aug. 7 bombings of 
U.S. embassies in East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said an 
interview with The Associated Press. On Aug. 20 the United States 
retaliated by firing Tomahawk missiles at suspected terrorist camps 
in eastern Afghanistan, killing 26 people. According to U.S. intelligence 
sources, the camps were being used to train members of bin Laden's 
al Qaeda terrorist group. ``America is looking for an excuse to fire 
more rockets on our dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden,'' 
Saqib said. Washington, which has posted a dlrs 5 million reward for 
bin Laden's arrest, hasn't ruled out further attacks on Afghanistan. 
Saqib, who heads a judicial inquiry established by the Taliban to 
investigate the terrorism charges against bin Laden, says the United 
States has become insecure. ``America fears its shadow ... in every 
part of the world it is afraid and sees every danger connected to 
bin Laden,'' he said in an interview in the Afghan capital of Kabul. 
In Afghanistan, bin Laden is considered an honored guest by his Taliban 
hosts. They cite Afghan tradition, which demands the host guarantee 
his guest protection. So far Saqib says he has no evidence of bin 
Laden's involvement in terrorist activities. The Taliban have refused 
to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there 
is evidence they will try him under Islamic law. In the 90 percent 
of Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban a harsh brand of Islamic justice 
has been imposed, including the death penalty. ``We want good relations 
with the United States and all Muslim and non-Muslim countries, but 
they have to respect our ways,'' he said. Saqib said his inquiry will 
wind up on Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence against bin Laden the 
case will be closed _ at least for the Taliban. ``Bin Laden is not 
a sinful man ... America has been silent ... they have given no evidence,'' 
he said. ``It is too shameful for America who is now seen by all that 
world to have no reason to go after bin Laden.'' 
 
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents this week began questioning relatives 
of the victims of the Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombing as well as the seriously 
injured on request of the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern 
District of New York, a U.S. official said Thursday. The blast at 
the embassy building in downtown Nairobi killed 213 people, 12 of 
them Americans, and injured 5,400. In an nearly simultaneous bombing 
of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam in neighboring Tanzania, 11 people 
were killed and 85 were injured, none of them Americans. The official, 
who could not be further identified, said the questioning was aimed 
at gathering recorded testimony to be used by the prosecution in the 
pre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection 
with the attack. Wadih El Hage, Mohamed Sadeek Odeh and Mohamed Rashed 
Daoud Al-'Owhali are being held by the U.S. District Court in the 
Southern District of New York. All three have pleaded innocent. Fazul 
Abdullah Mohammed is a fugitive. Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the 
alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to attack U.S. targets around the 
world, and Muhammad Atef, the alleged military commander of bin Laden's 
terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, were charged in a separate 238-page 
indictment with murder and conspiracy in the bombings. Bin Laden is 
believed to be living in Afghanistan. U.S. law provides for the trial 
in the United States of those charged in terror attacks against American 
citizens, even if carried out on foreign soil. 
 
Police arrested two journalists and charged them with writing articles 
to encourage Muslim youths to stage an Islamic revolution in Bangladesh 
after the Taliban model in Afghanistan, a police officer said Thursday. 
Mufti Abdul Hye and Manzoor Ahmed, editors at ``Jago Mujahid'' or 
``Wake Up Mujahid,'' a monthy magazine published from Dhaka, the Bangladeshi 
capital, were jailed for a month shortly after their arrest on Wednesday. 
They were arrested under a 1974 law that allows police to detain any 
one for offenses related to national security, the officer said on 
condition of anonymity. Those arrested need not be taken to court 
for trial for up to three months. Police seized copies of the newspaper 
for reproducing a foreign newspaper interview of Afghanistan-based 
Saudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden, who has been accused by the United 
States of masterminding bombing attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya 
and Tanzania in August. Under Taliban rules women may not study or 
work outside their houses, and all kinds of light entertainment including 
music are banned. Men must grow beards of a certain length and criminals 
are subjected to amputations and public executions Even though Bangladesh 
is a predominantly Muslim country, it is governed by secular laws. 
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's liberal government hasn't recognized 
the Taliban government in Afghanistan. 
 
The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania 
and Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he 
has lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban 
militia. The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, 
on Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama 
bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States. ``It's 
over, and America has not presented any evidence,'' Afghanistan's 
chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press in an 
interview at the Supreme Court building in the Afghan capital, Kabul. 
``Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin. ... He is 
a free man.'' The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political 
activity is banned and he has agreed to respect that, the Taliban 
information minister said in a statement Friday. The minister, Amir 
Khan Muttaqi, also disputed U.S. assertions that bin Laden is a rich 
man, saying the Saudi dissident has had his foreign assets frozen, 
a claim not immediately corroborated. 
 
Albania says it has uncovered a terrorist network operated by Osama 
Bin Laden, the Islamic fundamentalist accused of masterminding the 
August embassy bombings in Africa, and that it's members have infiltrated 
other parts of Europe, The Sunday Times reported. The newspaper quoted 
Fatos Klosi, the head of Shik, the Albanian intelligence service, 
as saying that Bin Laden's network had sent units to fight in Kosovo, 
the neighboring Serbian province. ``Egyptians, Saudi Arabians, Algerians, 
Tunisians, Sudanese and Kuwaitis _ they come from several different 
organizations,'' Klosi was quoted as telling The Sunday Times. He 
said he believed terrorists had already infiltrated other parts of 
Europe from bases in Albania through a traffic in illegal immigrants, 
who have been smuggled across the Mediterranean to Italy in huge numbers. 
Interpol believes more than 100,000 blank Albanian passports were 
stolen in riots last year, providing ample opportunity for terrorists 
to acquire false papers, the newspaper said. Apparent confirmation 
of the Bin Laden's activities came earlier this month during the murder 
trial of Claude Kader, 27, a French national and self-confessed member 
of Bin Laden's Albanian network, the newspaper said. Kader claimed 
during the trial that he had visited Albania to recruit and arm fighters 
for Kosovo, and that four of his associates were still at large. Bin 
Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in 1994 
after telling the government that he was head of a wealthy Saudi humanitarian 
agency wishing to help in Albania, the newspaper reported. 
 
The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a 
Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month 
to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind 
of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, according to 
U.S. intelligence officials. The evidence, the officials said last 
week, shows that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical 
plant in Khartoum, has had financial dealings with members of Islamic 
Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination there 
of President Anwar Sadat in 1981. Islamic Jihad, in turn, receives 
money and sponsorship from bin Laden and has been absorbed into his 
terror network, the officials added. This evidence was uncovered after 
the United States destroyed Idris' factory in a missile attack following 
the bombing of the U.S. embassies, the officials said. A spokesman 
for Idris denied the accusations, saying Idris had no ties either 
to bin Laden or to any Islamic terrorist groups. In a statement provided 
by Tim Pendry, his London-based adviser, Idris said: ``I have absolutely 
no relationship with any Islamic terrorist organization anywhere in 
the world. I have never met Mr. bin Laden, I have never spoken with 
him, I have never had any financial or business relationship with 
him, nor knowingly with anyone acting as his agent.'' U.S. officials 
say they have also received new reports of an increase in the Iraqi 
presence in Sudan since the missile attack. Officials said they were 
not certain what the Iraqis were now doing in Khartoum. But intelligence 
agents previously obtained evidence that the manager of the Shifa 
plant made frequent trips to Iraq, where he visited the head of the 
chemical weapons program. In addition, a soil sample that the CIA 
clandestinely took at the Shifa plant showed the presence of a chemical 
used in the production of VX nerve gas, a process used only by Iraq. 
The new evidence comes as President Clinton faces attack over his 
decision to strike the Shifa plant. Some State Department and CIA 
officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based 
on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden. 
The criticism is also based on the suspicion that the United States 
has poor data on Sudan, as the CIA station there has been closed since 
1995 and the entire U.S. Embassy since 1996. In addition, more than 
100 intelligence reports from a CIA informer in Sudan were withdrawn 
in January 1996 because they proved to be fabrications. That year 
a second informer warned of several terrorist threats, including one 
against Anthony Lake, then the national security adviser, but his 
reports proved impossible to confirm. Senior administration officials 
say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence 
of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, 
but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. 
Now they say that the new evidence against Idris has confirmed their 
initial suspicions about Al Shifa. At the time of the Aug. 20 cruise 
missile attack, Clinton administration officials acknowledge, they 
did not know that Idris owned the Shifa factory. The CIA, which had 
begun to scrutinize the plant 18 months earlier, believed the plant's 
ownership was irrelevant. ``What we knew about the ownership was that 
a lot of it couldn't be reliably established,'' said one senior U.S. 
intelligence official. Still, after the missile strike, when Idris 
was publicly identified as the owner, U.S. intelligence began to investigate 
his possible connections to chemical weapons and terrorism. A Sudanese 
expatriate who now lives in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, Idris, 46, was previously 
a senior manager of the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia. 
He bought the Shifa plant in March. Officials say U.S. intelligence 
has received reports that Idris launders money for international Islamic 
groups, and that he also has a stake in a company in Sudan that is 
40 percent owned by the Military Industrial Corporation, a government 
entity that the United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons 
development. Bin Laden has helped finance the Military Industrial 
Corp. in his effort to use Sudan as a base for chemical weapons production, 
and talked to Sudanese leaders about testing poisonous gases against 
U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, according to U.S. intelligence. But Pendry 
denied that Idris owned any businesses with the Military Industrial 
Corp. U.S. intelligence officials declined to provide details about 
the reports of Idris' financial dealings with members of Islamic Jihad. 
But they said that Islamic Jihad had now been consolidated into bin 
Laden's terrorist campaign. 
 
One of the clear but unstated objectives of last August's raid on 
Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and as many of his lieutenants 
as possible, administration officials now acknowledge. According to 
the officials, White House lawyers conducted a secret review in the 
months before the attack and concluded that such operations are legal 
under U.S. and international law. The officials said the raid was 
timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps 
at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would 
be meeting there with his chief operatives. A 1976 executive order 
bars anyone working for the U.S. government from plotting or carrying 
out assassinations. But officials said the White House legal opinion 
drafted before the Afghan strike asserts that the president has authority 
to target the ``infrastructure'' of terrorist groups that are attacking 
Americans. A top U.S. counterterrorism official said this week that 
the infrastructure of bin Laden's group is mostly ``human.'' ``As 
we said from the time of the Aug. 20 strike, the objective was to 
disrupt the training, organization and infrastructure of the bin Laden 
terrorist network at the Khost camps,'' said David C. Leavy, a spokesman 
for the National Security Council at the White House. Targeting infrastructure, 
officials acknowledged, can also mean destroying the leadership of 
a terrorist group. ``Command and control of an enemy is a justifiable 
target,'' Leavy said. Senior administration officials said they never 
discussed killing bin Laden in their planning sessions. His death, 
they said in interviews after the attack, would simply have been a 
side benefit. U.S. intelligence officials say they now believe that 
bin Laden was in the camp on the day of the attack, but he appears 
to have left unscathed before the missiles hit. Officials said there 
were reports that at least one of his senior lieutenants may have 
died in the attack, and that total casualties in the complex were 
between 50 and 100. Administration spokesmen have drawn a distinction 
between attempting to kill a specific person like bin Laden and attacking 
a group of people who command a terrorist organization. Administration 
officials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill 
bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors 
with leading a global war against U.S. interests. He has been linked 
to the Aug. 7 bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa. But a 
less subtle explanation was offered on Oct. 13 by Defense Secretary 
William Cohen, who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United 
States had been ``going after'' bin Laden and his colleagues. ``We 
weren't quite successful,'' Cohen continued, ``but we sent a message.'' 
Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said the secretary had not 
retracted his statements. The Los Angeles Times recently reported 
that the administration believed that it had a legal right to use 
deadly force against terrorist leaders. Bin Laden's organization was 
a significant concern for the Clinton administration even before the 
bombing of the U.S. embassies in East Africa. Last spring, officials 
said, U.S. intelligence considered a daring raid into Afghanistan 
to capture the Saudi exile. Officials said that at roughly the same 
time, the White House drafted the legal justification for military 
attacks against a terrorist leadership. That review, officials said, 
provided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the 
meeting at which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would 
be gathered. The review, by the National Security Council, was the 
basis for saying this operation did not violate the presidential order 
banning assassinations. That ban was imposed by President Ford in 
1975, after congressional investigators uncovered evidence that the 
CIA had plotted to assassinate Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, and 
others. The order said: ``No person employed by, or acting on behalf 
of the United States government shall engage in, or conspire to engage 
in, assassination.'' While it is, on its face, a sweeping and unqualified 
ban, it has been subject to interpretation and intense debate over 
the years. In 1986, the Reagan administration responded to a terrorist 
attack against U.S. soldiers in Germany with a bombing raid on Libya. 
The targets included the residence of the Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi. 
And in the Gulf War, U.S. forces used powerful bombs in an attempt 
to kill Saddam Hussein, the president of Iraq. The legal review conducted 
by the White House would appear to provide a precedent for future 
operations in similar circumstances. 
 
Sometime in the summer of 1997, an operative for Osama bin Laden sat 
down at his personal computer in a hideaway in Kenya. He was worried, 
he wrote in an angry dispatch, about the security of the ``East Africa 
network'' of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of masterminding a 
worldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans. The organization, 
the author complained, had declared war against the United States, 
yet he had learned of that only from the news media. The writer, who 
federal authorities believe was Haroun Fazil, who was to become one 
of the central suspects in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi 
a year later, noted with alarm British press reports about the arrest 
of an aide to bin Laden. Striking almost bureaucratic tones, he said 
he was worried that ``an important man with close links'' to bin Laden, 
seemed to have ``fallen into the enemy's hands.'' He said the Americans 
were breathing down the necks of his associates in Nairobi and that 
he had to take precautions. ``The cell is at 100 percent danger,'' 
the operative warned. The letter, an extraordinary bit of digital 
evidence in a cloak-and-dagger case, was retrieved from a computer 
in a house where Fazil had been staying, according to papers filed 
in U.S. District Court in New York City. The papers said the computer 
was seized in August 1997 in a raid by Kenyan authorities that was 
attended by an FBI agent. The documents did not make clear whether 
the FBI had translated and read the document before or after the bombings 
of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 
7 of this year. The timing is potentially important because there 
have been mounting questions since the bombings about whether the 
United States adequately followed up warnings of a possible terrorist 
attack on American targets in Kenya. Officials of the FBI and the 
U.S. attorney's office in New York City refused to say Tuesday night 
at what point FBI agents learned of the computer file, nor would they 
make any other comment. Fazil eluded American investigators after 
the bombing as he traveled from Kenya to his home in the Comoros Islands 
and then to the Middle East. He remains a fugitive. The dispatch provides 
a remarkable insight into the workings of a terrorist network in the 
twilight of the 20th century. The author talks of how he and his fellow 
operatives follow events on CNN and use the Internet to communicate. 
He refers to himself as the media information officer of the East 
Africa cell and complains that he is not being kept in the loop on 
big decisions. Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document 
seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against 
bin Laden: That he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that 
his operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin Laden's 
door by federal authorities _ the attacks on American soldiers in 
Somalia in 1993 and 1994. The writer of the document warned that the 
followers of bin Laden, whom he referred to as ``the sheik,'' had 
``become America's primary target.'' He said his comrades in East 
Africa ``should know that there is an American-Kenyan-Egyptian intelligence 
activity in Nairobi aiming to identify the names and residences of 
the members who are associated with the sheik since America knows 
well that the youth who lived in Somalia and were members of the sheik's 
cell are the ones who killed Americans in Somalia.'' ``They know that 
since Kenya was the main gateway for those members, there must be 
a center in Kenya,'' he wrote, concluding: ``We are really in danger.'' 
The government has asserted that one of Fazil's duties was to prepare 
and transmit reports to bin Laden and his top lieutenants. Federal 
authorities said that Khalid al Fawwaz, a London-based associate of 
bin Laden, directed Fazil to ``report periodically to bin Laden about 
the ``security'' situation of the cell. Fawwaz, who served as an informal 
press spokesman for bin Laden in London, was arrested by British authorities 
in September after the embassy bombings. He has denied any connection 
to terrorist activities. A translation of the report was part of a 
package of documents American prosecutors have sent to Britain to 
support the extradition of Fawwaz for trial in New York. It is not 
clear from the materials whether the report in the computer was forwarded 
to bin Laden. The documents, which were initially filed in secret, 
include a federal complaint that accuses Fawwaz of conspiring with 
bin Laden to kill Americans overseas. A second count charges him with 
soliciting others to do so. The report made clear that the organization 
was being run on a shoestring. Its author wrote that his mother has 
fallen ill, and that he would like to return to his homeland for a 
visit. ``What do you think? Keep in mind we only have $500.'' He repeatedly 
expressed his fears of American intelligence, which he believed was 
in the midst of a worldwide search for bin Laden and his associates. 
``There is a war and the situation is dangerous,'' he said. He wrote 
that American forces kidnapped anyone who threatened the national 
security or American citizens. The author noted with alarm a recent 
CIA operation in which a man accused of shooting agency employees 
had been lured across the border in Pakistan and returned to the United 
States for trial. According to federal authorities, Fazil went on 
to play a pivotal role in the bombing of the Nairobi embassy. Prosecutors 
assert that he rented the villa where the bomb was assembled and surveyed 
the embassy's security precautions. On Aug. 7, they charge, Fazil 
drove a pickup truck to the embassy, leading the way for a vehicle 
carrying the bomb that killed more than 200 people, including 12 Americans. 
The author of the report said that he stood ready to ``fight the forces 
of atheism and dictators who wreaked havoc on earth.'' He said that 
the group did not have to inform its Nairobi-based operatives of all 
its global plans, but they needed enough warning to go ``underground 
for a while'' if authorities intensified the pressure in Nairobi. 
``We, the East Africa cell members, do not want to know about the 
operations plans,'' he wrote, `` since we are just implementers.'' 
 
If Osama bin Laden ever stands trial in New York for the bombings 
of the U.S. embassies in Africa and other acts of terror, it is already 
clear who prosecutors will call as a chief witness: One of his senior 
aides who has been talking to U.S. investigators for two years. The 
government has identified the aide in court papers with the pseudonym 
CS-1, saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret 
proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan. According to the government, 
the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period 
when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere. From the court papers filed 
in the investigation of the embassy bombings in East Africa in August, 
it is clear that the informant has provided crucial information to 
federal investigators. They have cited the source in the papers filed 
to support the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who are 
under arrest in Germany and Britain. Bin Laden, a Saudi exile, is 
thought to be living in Afghanistan. The source is also the basis 
for many of the significant charges in the indictment against bin 
Laden himself, including the assertion that he directed the attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and that he attempted to obtain nuclear 
weapons. It is not known whether the source is in custody somewhere, 
or hiding under government protection. As recently as 11 days ago, 
records show, the source swore to a 5-page affidavit before a New 
York notary summarizing his allegations against bin Laden. Government 
officials adamantly declined to say anything about the identity of 
CS-1, which stands for ``confidential source.'' But at least one operative 
of bin Laden's group in East Africa concluded more than a year ago 
that he knew the identity of a crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, a businessman 
who was married to one of bin Laden's relatives. The operative's concerns 
were inflamed by a report in a British newspaper that Tayyib was cooperating 
with Saudi and U.S. authorities. In an August, 1997 article, The Daily 
Telegraph said Tayyib had been in custody in Saudi Arabia since May 
and had given intelligence officials details of bin Laden's bank accounts 
and businesses. The news of Tayyib's possible defection, the East 
African operative wrote in a report apparently intended for the group's 
commanders, ``almost made me explode. ``An important man with close 
links to'' bin Laden ``seems to have fallen into the enemy's hands, 
and we have to take all the appropriate security precautions against 
that,'' the operative, Haroun Fazil, wrote in his summary of security 
concerns. Fazil has since been charged in the embassy attacks and 
remains at large. The report was typed on a computer seized last year 
by Kenyan authorities, according to a government filing last week 
in U.S. district court in Manhattan. Thus far, U.S. prosecutors have 
charged at least six members of bin Laden's organization with terrorist 
activities or conspiracy. In one recent filing, they said their case 
will in part be ``based on the testimony'' of the confidential source, 
suggesting that the informant has agreed to testify at any trial of 
bin Laden or his associates. The arrangement appears to have resulted 
from a plea bargain in which the source is cooperating in hopes of 
receiving a lesser sentence. There is no indication that the source 
has yet been sentenced and it seems likely that sentencing would take 
place after the investigation and ensuing trials are complete. In 
the affidavit prepared last week, the source acknowledged pleading 
guilty to terrorism charges in the United States and said they stemmed 
from attacks on U.S. targets, which were not specifically identified. 
The source described taking ``an oath of allegiance'' to follow bin 
Laden's orders, and gave a detailed account of bin Laden's group, 
including its history and inner workings. The source told of private 
statements by bin Laden to other al Qaeda members, encouraging them 
to attack U.S. troops and other citizens stationed in the Middle East 
and Africa. ``I either heard these statements myself,'' the source

","After the bombing of U.S. embassies in East Africa the U.S. on Aug. 20, 1998 made missile attacks on an Al-Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan and on a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan tenuously linked to Osama bin Laden.
In September the U.S. initiated legal action against a Sudanese arrested in Germany and in November charges were prepared against six men including bin Laden.
The U.S. had, in support of its case, documentary evidence and a cooperative former senior aide of bin Laden.
Meanwhile, authorities reported bin Laden agents active in Bangladesh and the Balkans and the Taliban government of Afghanistan proclaimed bin Laden ""a man without sin.

In a critical ruling for the North American National Basketball Association 
and the players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether 
more than 200 players with guaranteed contracts should be paid during 
the lockout. If the players win, the owners will be liable for about 
dlrs 800 million in guaranteed salaries, although they have vowed 
to appeal if they lose. The league already has sued the players over 
Feerick's jurisdiction. ``If we win, I think it just emboldens the 
spirit and resolve of the players,'' union director Billy Hunter said. 
``But I don't think there will be anybody celebrating because there's 
no guarantee that it will end the lockout. ``It only means they have 
to pay some 200 players, and they've indicated to us their intent 
to file an immediate appeal and take it as far as they have to in 
order to avoid payment. ``So even if he does rule in our favor, at 
most it's a hollow victory. The players aren't going to get paid Nov. 
15 in any circumstance,'' Hunter said. If the owners win, it will 
remove the last wild card the players had been holding. The sides 
have not negotiated since last Tuesday, when the union proposed a 
superstar tax on the highest contracts. The league made a counterproposal 
Friday, asking that the tax be imposed with a much lower threshold. 
Hunter dismissed the league's latest proposal on Friday afternoon, 
then said both sides would be best served by awaiting Feerick's ruling. 
It's unlikely any negotiations will be held this week, since the union 
is holding a meeting for all NBA players and the agents advisory committee 
in Las Vegas from Wednesday through Friday. ``We've got to get a sense 
of where the players are, what they consider to be reasonable and 
what they're willing to do in order to get the season to commence,'' 
Hunter said. The union filed a grievance with Feerick before the lockout 
was imposed July 1 over the owners' announcement June 29 that they 
would not honor guaranteed deals. In a six-day hearing over the summer, 
the union argued that owners should have protected themselves from 
being liable for guaranteed salaries during a work stoppage by inserting 
lockout language into the standard player contract. The Sacramento 
Kings inserted a lockout clause into center Olden Polynice's contract 
in 1994, and it was approved by the league. The union used the existence 
of that clause to argue that all the other teams should have protected 
themselves similarly. Most players are due to receive their first 
paychecks Nov. 15, although a dozen or so had clauses entitling them 
to be paid over the summer. None has received a paycheck. The NBA 
argued that a tenet of labor law allows employers to withhold pay 
from employees during a lockout. The league also called former union 
director Simon Gourdine to testify. He said it was his understanding 
when he negotiated the old labor agreement in 1995 that players would 
not be paid if the owners chose to reopen the agreement and impose 
a lockout.

He was the classic small-town prodigy, with the creativity of a big-city 
profiteer. When there was no shot to take, he invented a new one. 
When there was no one to pass to, he reconfigured the play until a 
teammate was open. Larry Bird, in the Indiana countryside or inside 
Boston Garden, was a luminous exception to the governing rule. That 
is why, six years after his retirement from the National Basketball 
Association, his name is again basketball's most prominent, beginning 
with his induction to the Hall of Fame before 7,000 Bird watchers 
at the Civic Center here on Friday night. Deservedly enshrined as 
forever exceptional, he again becomes Bird, the exception, the case 
study for a contentious and potentially disastrous labor war. ``No, 
not really,'' Bird said, when I asked whether he is troubled by the 
likelihood of his legendary name soon representing a symbol of greed 
to unsympathetic millions. ``There's always a player's name attached 
to these things. I know at the time I was very happy about it.'' That 
would have been 1988, when the Celtics wanted to compensate Bird with 
a $4.9 million bonus to push through his back pain, go on as their 
savior. Three years later, in a contract arbitration involving the 
Knicks' Patrick Ewing, the agent David Falk would contend that the 
NBA conspired with the Celtics to circumvent the salary cap, in order 
to satisfy Bird. Alan Greenspan, I am sure, would agree that this 
salary cap is convoluted enough to give anyone a headache, so let's 
just say it is a cap that does not exist when a team is negotiating 
with one of its own. The process of unsealing the cap to re-sign a 
particular player eventually became known as making use of the Larry 
Bird exception. And that is where we stand, as this onetime exception 
has become the very expensive rule the owners don't want to play by 
anymore. ``I can understand both sides,'' said Bird, safely in the 
middle, between Bird, the former exception, and Bird, the present 
Indiana Pacers' coach. ``Without getting into the exception, I think 
it's very important for players to stay in the same place.'' Important, 
he meant, for franchise stability and fan identification. ``You have 
a son who is 7 years old, he goes from 7 to 17 in the 10 years you've 
played,'' Bird said. ``A lot of people in Boston told me that they 
had followed me, from the time they were very young to when they were 
in college.'' The Bird years numbered only three Celtics championships, 
but he was the best player pro basketball's most famous team ever 
had. He and Magic Johnson created a basketball renaissance that began 
during a college title showdown in Salt Lake City and spread worldwide, 
like an infectious smile. They stood for the pass, for team play, 
but now their decade of selflessness has given way to one of selfishness. 
The NBA of Michael Jordan reached greater heights than anyone imagined 
it could, but it is a league that now suffers from a sickness of the 
soul. ``If Larry and Magic hadn't done what they did, we might not 
survive what we're about to go through,'' said Bill Fitch, Bird's 
first Celtics coach, who, with Bill Walton, stood with him on the 
night that, he said, gave closure to his playing career. The owners, 
as always, are exaggerating their misery, but this time, it is much 
easier to not root for the players. The president of the union is 
Ewing, who one day commands players to boycott the world championships 
because the NBA's corporate fingerprints are on them, then the next 
day helps himself to some television commentary work for David Stern's 
women's annex. Ewing leads the fight to protect the $100 million contracts 
for 21-year-olds who have achieved not a single playoff victory, linked 
to the big payoffs for agents like his friend Falk. The battle is 
waged in the name of a salary cap that makes exceptions of the unexceptional, 
rewards everyone as if they were Bird. ``I believe that in any field 
there has to be an allowance for the truly special ones,'' Walton 
said. ``But that group is very small. When I was growing up in this 
sport, the only players who got the recognition were the champions, 
the ones who always made you feel good about the game, about sports. 
That's how Larry and Magic played, always dreaming of the special 
team. It wasn't about hype, about money.'' That is not quite the case, 
nor should it have been. Bird was a businessman's ball player from 
the day he arrived, with his flannel shirts and blue-collar ethic. 
He hired the late Bob Woolf, one of the original heavy-hitting agents, 
and got himself a record rookie contract. Then he went out and turned 
a 29-victory catastrophe into a 61-victory contender. A rare Bird, 
an honest exception to the rule. 
 
In a decision that will almost certainly lead to the first work stoppage 
in National Basketball Association history, the league Monday announced 
the cancellation of all 114 preseason games. Citing stalled negotiations 
with the Players Association over a new collective bargaining agreement, 
league officials said they would decide next week whether to cancel 
the first week of regular season games. While the decision had been 
expected for 10 days, it nonetheless sent a strong signal that the 
owners and players will probably be willing to cancel at least part 
of the regular season in order to settle their labor dispute. Both 
sides agree that it would take at least three weeks to hold abbreviated 
training camps and sign over 200 free agents to new contracts. Privately, 
officials on both sides do not believe the season will start as scheduled 
on Nov. 3 or even before December. Unlike Major League Baseball, the 
National Football League and the National Hockey League, the NBA has 
never lost a regular-season game to labor strife. ``Since we're not 
even negotiating, you have to conclude it's very likely that we're 
going miss some part of the regular season,'' deputy commissioner 
Russ Granik said Monday night. ``We'll try and defer any decisions 
until the last minute, but right now it does not look good.'' The 
two sides will meet on Thursday _ their first official bargaining 
session since Aug. 6. Commissioner David Stern and a group of owners 
walked out of a meeting after dismissing the merits of a new proposal 
from the players. Neither Granik nor players association executive 
director Billy Hunter sounded as if this week's meeting would go a 
long way toward the signing of a new agreement _ the precursor to 
playing again. ``I don't think you have any choice but to miss games 
at this point,'' Hunter said. ``In fact, I think the they've intended 
it all along. They've locked us out, they've refused to negotiate 
and they've given us a proposal that's ludicrous.'' Not only are both 
sides still awaiting the outcome of an arbitration decision that is 
due before Oct. 18 - the Fordham Law School dean John Feerick will 
rule whether or not more than 200 players with $800 million in guaranteed 
contracts should be paid during the lockout _ but the owners and players 
also are making time to win public opinion before they test their 
fans' loyalties by canceling games. Monday in 11 cities throughout 
the country, the players are holding make-shift press conferences 
at training-camp venues, NBA arenas and gymnasiums. Patrick Ewing, 
the union president, and several teammates will speak at SUNY-Purchase 
in Purchase, N.Y., where the Knicks train during the season. With 
training camp originally scheduled to open on Oct. 6, the message 
from the players is clear: if the owners would call an end to the 
lockout, we would be ready to play today. About 100 players are expected 
to attend, speak and sign autographs for fans afterward. ``I wish 
they would put their energies into trying to negotiate a deal rather 
than the various other things that they've been doing,'' Granik said. 
The dispute is essentially over how the owners and players will judiciously 
divvy up $2 billion in income. It began last year with the contention 
by the owners that their employees were receiving more than their 
fair share of the pot. The owners were allowed to terminate the current 
agreement because of a clause that enabled them to do so after player 
salaries reached 53.8 percent of total basketball-related income. 
The owners say that figure is currently hovering around 57.1 percent. 
Though many economic issues need to be resolved, the main point of 
contention since the labor agreement expired and the owners declared 
a lockout on July 1 has been a clause which allows teams to pay their 
own free agents whatever they want, regardless of salary-cap rules 
governing the NBA's 29 teams. Called the Larry Bird exception, it 
was created to allow the Hall of Fame Boston Celtics forward to re-sign 
with the Celtics near the end of his career. Michael Jordan exercised 
the clause the last two years with the Chicago Bulls, earning more 
than $30 million per season _ figures more than $5 million more what 
a team is allowed to spend on all its players. But with exorbitant 
salaries paid to several unproven stars over the last few years and 
$100 million deals sprouting up routinely, the owners are determined 
to swing the income pendulum back toward themselves by enforcing a 
restricted salary cap _ a hard cap _ and putting a ceiling on how 
much one player could earn. ``Last year, the players received about 
$1 billion dollars in salaries and benefits and we have made proposals 
that are guaranteed to increase that number by 20 percent over the 
next four years,'' Granik said in a prepared statement. ``Our proposals 
would result in an average player salary of more than $3.1 million 
and a minimum salary for 10-year veterans of $750,000. Unfortunately, 
the union leadership has been unwilling to give any serious consideration 
to what we have offered.'' Hunter labeled those claims as optimistic 
projections, and shot down a number of new proposals presented to 
the players on Sept. 25. ``If they had left the current deal in place, 
we would have gotten much of that anyway,'' he added. ``All we're 
saying is, we're not in position to accept a hard cap.'' Monday's 
decision to cancel the preseason came less than two weeks after the 
NBA indefinitely postponed training camp and canceled the first week 
of exhibition games. Through tickets sales alone, Granik estimated 
that losing the exhibition season would cost the league between $35 
million and $40 million. Decisions about the cancellations of regular 
season games are expected to be made next week, he added. A league 
official said the games would be canceled in blocks of one or two 
weeks, depending upon circumstances regarding negotiations. Thursday's 
bargaining session has suddenly become the last hope at starting the 
season on time. ``Hurdles could be overcome very quickly, but I have 
no reason to believe they will on Thursday,'' Granik said. Added Hunter: 
``Of course they don't expect much to get done. When Russ and David 
decide the negotiations are going to be real and substantive, then 
something will happen. What they're banking on now is that the players 
are going to miss paychecks and cave in November. It's as if they've 
ingested something that has to pass. And once it passes, then they'll 
negotiate.'' 
 
Patrick Ewing did not want to sound like a striking longshoreman demanding 
health benefits. ``I'm not going to try and put it in dollars and 
cents.'' But Ewing, president of the National Basketball Association 
Players Association, played the public-relations game Tuesday by expounding 
on the themes of labor unrest: strong-willed unity and short-sighted 
proposals. On the day when training camps were scheduled to begin, 
players from across the country held news conferences in 14 NBA cities 
to proclaim themselves ready to practice for the regular season. ``We 
want to show the public that we, as players, want to play,'' said 
Ewing, who was flanked by five teammates. ``Today is supposed to be 
the start of training camp. We want to practice and we want the season 
to start. But unfortunately, the owners have locked us out and the 
season has been postponed.'' The owners and players are scheduled 
hold their first bargaining session since Aug. 6 on Thursday in Manhattan. 
Neither side is predicting progress toward signing a new collective 
bargaining agreement and beginning the season as scheduled on Nov. 
3. The league canceled the entire 114-game preseason on Monday. Next 
week, it will consider canceling the first-ever regular season games 
in league history. With wide philosophical differences on how $2 billion 
annual income should be distributed, both sides have privately said 
they don't expect to play a regular season game before December. Billy 
Hunter, the union's executive director, offered a glimmer of hope. 
He spoke optimistically about the potential for a quick resolution. 
Standing a few feet away from Ewing, he said, ``I hope the owners 
and commissioner have gotten the message: that we're serious about 
a deal. I'm prepared to make a quantum leap. I don't think we're that 
far off. I think there's a lot jockeying, a lot of rhetoric and a 
lot of games being played. But if and when the owners decide they 
want a deal, then they'll get one.'' But soon after, he began lambasting 
the owners' latest proposal, which includes the eventual phasing out 
of the Larry Bird exception _ the clause that enables free agents 
to earn unlimited salaries from their current teams. That clause represents 
the major rift in negotiations. Owners would like to implement a restrictive 
salary cap that would eventually put a ceiling on how much one player 
can earn. ``I don't know if this is going to come to a speedy resolution,'' 
Ewing said. ``They're entrenched with what they want, which is a hard 
cap. And we feel with a hard cap, we as players, cannot survive. We 
would have to be stupid and ignorant to accept that deal.'' Said Hunter, 
``If you go for their proposal, it's just a joke. It's a step backwards. 
I cannot understand it. If the intent was to reach an agreement at 
this late stage or to negotiate in earnest, this was the wrong way 
to go about it.'' League officials did not respond to the players' 
comments. ``All we want is our fair share and we feel like they're 
trying to take that away from us,'' Ewing said. `There's a perception 
that we're on strike. It's the other way around. We've been locked 
out.'' Besides Ewing, the other Knicks included former union president 
Buck Williams, former vice president Herb Williams, Allan Houston 
and John Starks. Marcus Camby also showed up briefly. When the media 
horde closed in, however, the third-year forward went to look for 
his late-arriving teammates inside the practice facility. He was stopped 
at the gym door, which was locked. ``They locked us out,'' said Rockets 
forward Mario Elie. ``Everybody's got to get that corrected. It's 
not on us. They're the ones that closed us down.'' The stalemate has 
elicited talks of possibly bringing in a mediator in the coming weeks, 
as Major League Baseball did in 1994 to help solve its labor dispute. 
But the players are convinced commissioner David Stern and the owners 
are set on testing their resolve before any genuine headway can be 
made in negotiations. That means missing paychecks in November, something 
Ewing said the players are prepared to do. Both sides are still awaiting 
the outcome of an arbitration decision that is due before Oct. 18. 
Fordham Law School dean John Feerick will rule whether or not more 
than 200 players with $800 million in guaranteed contracts should 
be paid during the lockout. Feerick's decision could give new leverage 
to one side. But if the players lose the arbitration, more than 400 
athletes _ many with extravagant lifestyles and tremendous financial 
obligations _ will have their allegiances instantly tested. ``It's 
like they want to see how strong we are,'' Ewing said. ``Based on 
the proposals we've received, we're very strong.'' ``So far, it seems 
as though the NBA is dug in on their position,'' Buck Williams said. 
``I don't think they're too concerned at this point about making a 
deal. He added, ``We're about as far apart as the Grand Canyon right 
now.'' 
 
The first substantive talks in more than two months between opposing 
sides of the National Basketball Association's labor dispute came 
and went Thursday without a hint of a settlement. Still, a five-hour 
meeting that was described as cordial by the league and ``almost like 
two bulls letting off a little steam'' by the players association 
produced another scheduled round of talks next Tuesday. Barring a 
major compromise, that will not be enough time to preserve a full 
season and prevent the league from losing its first regular-season 
games to labor strife in November. Russ Granik, the NBA's deputy commissioner, 
said the league would wait until after next week's meeting before 
deciding to cancel regular-season games. He also discussed the possibility 
of a significantly shortened season. ``We haven't made a determination 
that you need this exact number of games in order to have a representative 
season,'' Granik said. ``But we recognize that beyond a certain point 
we can't possibly sell to our fans that we're having an NBA season. 
``Whether's that 60 games, 50 games or 49 or 53, we're not there yet. 
We have a few months before we have to face that decision.'' Perhaps 
the only progress involved Thursday in the conference room of a midtown 
Manhattan hotel was a question-and-answer session over the league's 
latest proposal to the players. Patrick Ewing, the union president, 
and vice presidents Herb Williams and Dikembe Mutombo attended the 
meeting with the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, and union 
lawyers. No owners were present, but Granik, Commissioner David Stern 
and the league's lawyers spent most of the day explaining the intricacies 
of a two-week-old proposal to the players. At one point before the 
two parties broke for lunch, Stern and Hunter raised their voices 
and accused each other of handling their constituencies poorly, a 
participant in the meeting said. But the two were seen shaking hands 
and laughing after the meeting concluded shortly after 3 p.m. ``There 
was some venting from both sides,'' Hunter said. ``We've been placid 
and very respectful. Today, we took the coats off and we were inclined 
to take the gloves off a little bit. Having done that, I think it 
kind of loosened up both sides.'' Hunter added: ``Did anybody blink 
today? They're sort of look at us for any kind of nuance they can 
find during the course of negotiations that might, in some way or 
another, give some indication that while we're mouthing one thing 
we might be open to something else. We're looking at their body language, 
too. I don't think that they're ready to make a deal.'' The last formal 
meeting between both sides on Aug. 6 ended when Stern and the owners 
abruptly marched out after they had received a proposal from the players. 
 
Despite modest encouragement over a new proposal delivered by the 
players to the owners, the National Basketball Association Tuesday 
canceled the first two weeks of the regular season, the first time 
in the league's 51-year history that it will lose games to a labor 
dispute. The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced the 
cancellation after nearly three and a half hours of meetings concluded 
at a Manhattan hotel. The decision to cancel 99 games between Nov. 
3 and Nov. 16 came after the players association proposed the implementation 
of a tax system instead of a hard salary cap, a proposal the owners 
said they would respond to by Friday. ``We tried our best today to 
try to do what was possible to salvage the season,'' said Alonzo Mourning, 
the Miami Heat center. ``Unfortunately, it didn't work out.'' After 
35,001 games without a blemish, the NBA now joins the National Hockey 
League, the National Football League and Major League Baseball in 
having lost games to a labor dispute. Taking into account that a three- 
to four-week period would be needed for training camp and free-agent 
signings before the season starts, the league said it would decide 
in two weeks whether to make further cancellations. ``I'm very sad 
and disappointed,'' said the NBA commissioner, David Stern. ``I consider 
it to be a collective failure, but I honestly don't know what else 
we could have done. I do things that I like to think are in the best 
interests of the game. And I believe this is.'' The decision came 
after what both sides agreed were the most substantive talks since 
the owners imposed a lockout on the player July 1. Seventeen players, 
including union president Patrick Ewing and vice presidents Mitch 
Richmond, Herb Williams, Dikemebe Mutombo and Ty Corbin, attended 
the meeting along with Stern, Granik and five members of the ownership 
committee _ Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts and owners 
Abe Pollin of Washington, Gordon Gund of Cleveland, Les Alexander 
of Houston and Jerry Colangelo of Phoenix. The talks featured what 
the players association implied were a bevy concessions made to the 
owners that they felt would accommodate the league's desire to swing 
the revenue pendulum back toward the owners. The dispute involves 
the distribution of approximately $2 billion in league-wide income. 
The main sticking point has been the owners' insistence on a salary 
cap without exceptions, the implementation of which they believe would 
bring player salaries' in line with revenue growth. While the players 
did not discuss the elimination of the Larry Bird exception _ a clause 
that allows a player to secure any amount of money he wants in re-signing 
with his current team _ they did address the exception in their taxation 
proposal. The main points were as follows: _ A 50 percent tax would 
be imposed on salary earned above $18 million, a clause that would 
affect only a few players who exercised their Bird rights. For example, 
if a player made $20 million, the team would be forced to put $1 million 
into a fund that would most likely be distributed to low-revenue teams. 
``There could be provisions made for some players,'' said Jeffrey 
Kessler, the chief outside counsel for the union. ``We don't want 
to do anything that would encourage Chicago from getting Michael Jordan 
back. And I think the league feels the same way.'' The proposal is 
similar to the luxury tax proposed by the union in 1995 during negotiations, 
but it would not be nearly as liberal. _ A salary cap credit would 
go into effect if the league pays out more than 63 percent of revenues 
in salary. Whatever figure over that number reduces the salary cap 
the next year. If the figure was $29 million over the salary cap, 
then the 29 teams would work with a salary cap $1 million less than 
the previous season. But the players would have an assurance that 
the salary cap would go up at least $2 million before the credit goes 
into effect. _ Also, if the 63-percent threshold is met, a reduction 
of annual 20 percent raises would take effect for multi-year contracts. 
Players would either get raises of 10 percent or the rate of growth 
in league revenues. The union said this clearly addresses the league's 
desire to bring salaries in line with revenues. Since the owners re-opened 
the current agreement because 57.1 percent of revenue was going toward 
salaries, the 63-percent figure would probably have to come down substantially 
for the owners to agree to such a proposal. _ Teams would get a right 
of first refusal on free agents after the fourth year for incoming 
rookies, meaning a player would be contractually obligated to the 
same team for the first four years of his deal. Currently, the rookie 
scale is three years and includes a clause that enables a player to 
exercise his Bird rights after two seasons _ a clause Kevin Garnett 
parlayed into an astronomical $126 million deal last year with Minnesota. 
_ Finally, the players agreed to make marijuana a banned substance. 
Details of testing have not been negotiated and no specific discussions 
took place regarding testing for performance-enhancing drugs, a provision 
the owners included in their last proposal. In return for the concessions, 
the players want an increase in the minimum salary _ currently $272,500 
_ and creation of an average salary exception. This would allow every 
team above the salary cap being able to sign one free agent per year 
for the average salary _ currently $2.6 million. ``We're buoyed by 
the fact for the first time they've decided to submit a counterproposal,'' 
the union's executive director, Billy Hunter, said. ``I don't know 
if I'm more optimistic, but I can earnestly say we can look our ballplayers 
in the eye and say we made a valiant effort.'' Asked if the players 
would finally be tested financially with the cancellation of games, 
Hunter added: ``It's not about us blinking. We want to reach an agreement. 
We're tired of the rhetoric, we're tired of the game-playing. Our 
position all along has been we don't want to accept a bad deal.'' 
Granik said refunds to fans would be made at end of the calendar month 
and that the first refund would include monies for canceled preseason 
games. He estimated the losses into the ``hundreds of millions of 
dollars.'' ``I think we have serious concern whether a tax system 
can address the kind of needs we have economically,'' he added. ``But 
there's some possibility.'' Added Stern, ``We owe it to the fans to 
go back and look at the notion whether a tax rate might begin to achieve 
the result we wanted. It doesn't look promising, but we're going to 
spend the next two days to see if we can give a favorable response.'' 
Though the decision to cancel games was not surprising, it did represent 
a major shift in prior labor stalemates. Both sides reluctantly hammered 
out a deal in 1995 before the start of training camp with the sole 
notion of not missing games and preserving the NBA's perfect record. 
Tuesday, they could not come to such an accord. ``I'd like to think 
these our the last games we have to cancel,'' Granik said. ``But unless 
this or something else works, or there's some dramatic breakthrough, 
I think that is certainly not all of the season that's in jeopardy.'' 
 
The National Basketball Association, embroiled in a labor dispute 
with its players, Tuesday canceled the first two weeks of the 1998-99 
season. It is the first time in the league's 51-year history that 
it will lose regular-season games. The NBA's deputy commissioner, 
Russ Granik, announced the cancellation after nearly three and a half

More than 220 National Basketball Association players with guaranteed 
contracts will find out Monday whether they are to be paid during 
the management lockout, a long-awaited arbitrator's decision that 
may affect leverage in the league's dispute with the players and have 
major ramifications on American sports-labor law. But neither the 
players nor the owners are counting on the ruling by the arbitrator, 
John Feerick, to speed up negotiations, especially if Feerick finds 
in favor of the players, an award that could approach $800 million 
in salaries. NBA attorneys have indicated to the union that if the 
decision goes against management, they will seek to have it vacated 
by appealing to the U.S. District Court in Manhattan and then, if 
necessary, to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a process that 
could prevent the players from getting paid for several months. The 
NBA has already canceled the first two weeks of the regular season 
because of the labor dispute. The league has other litigation pending 
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. If the players win the ruling, 
the NBA intends to renew its motion to disqualify Feerick. The motion 
was brought last summer on the grounds that no collective bargaining 
agreement existed and, therefore, he had no jurisdiction to hear the 
matter. ``If he rules in our favor, I think it emboldens the spirit 
and the resolve of the players,'' said Billy Hunter, union executive 
director. ``But we understand that won't end the lockout. It just 
means they have to pay 200-some players. And there is still other 
litigation alive that may take a while to resolve. At most, it's a 
hollow victory.'' Feerick will have taken the full 30 days to render 
his decision. Whatever he decides, his ruling will be watched carefully. 
There is no precedent for locked-out athletes being paid. During the 
NBA summer lockout of 1995, players who missed paychecks did not file 
a grievance. Neither did National Hockey League players who were locked 
out for the first three months of the 1994-95 season. The union argued 
that owners should have protected themselves by inserting clauses 
about non-payment for lockouts and strikes into individual player 
contracts. In support of its arguments, the union pointed to clauses 
in a few individual player contracts that contained language precluding 
payment during a lockout. The league is relying on the basic tenets 
of labor law, which hold that employees not be paid during strikes 
or lockouts. A ruling for the union would be significant for all future 
negotiations between players and owners. The deterrent factor of a 
lockout is that employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
do not get paid once the agreement expires and they are unable to 
reach a new agreement. If Feerick finds in favor of the players, there 
will be no economic incentive for those with guaranteed contracts 
to reach an agreement quickly. They would essentially be paid for 
not playing basketball. If Feerick finds in favor of the owners, the 
reality of not being paid may spur the players to reach an agreement 
more quickly. But Hunter disputed this notion, and in a conference 
call Friday talked openly about the entire season's being canceled 
before the players would back away from their ultimate goals. ``I'm 
not at all concerned,'' Hunter said. ``There's been no demonstration 
that there's going to be a change in our resolve. After the players 
saw these proposals from the league and the recent posturing by NBA 
owners, well, I had two players call me up and tell me, if need be, 
they'd be willing to hock everything they've got.'' Another significant 
development may be thedeparture of many players to Europe until the 
dispute is settled, according to at least two player agents. ``I think 
it would be a case-by-case basis, but yes, there's already some people 
talking about that,'' said Bill Strickland, a member of the union's 
agents advisory committee. Steve Kauffman, another member of the committee, 
said he would explore the possibility that one client, Nets center 
Rony Seikaly, would sign with a professional team in Greece. ``We 
wouldn't look to void his deal with the team,'' Kauffman said. ``But 
we would want him to have the right for him to work temporarily until 
he could come back and honor his contract.' Russ Granik, NBA deputy 
commissioner, said the league has approved the idea of players' earning 
a living elsewhere until the lockout is settled. Proposals exchanged 
last week that included the concept of a luxury-tax system on player 
salaries appeared to reflect the first signs of progress in negotiations 
since the lockout began July 1. But both sides have termed the figures 
in each other's proposal as unacceptable, and it was unclear whether 
either side was willing compromise. ``I don't think we should get 
too carried away about the possibilities just yet,'' Granik said. 
``When they explored the idea of a tax system, we were taking the 
players at their word that they wanted to make some headway. But to 
call their first proposal meaningless is charitable. They proposed 
something that has no impact. As it stands, that can't be the solution.'' 
The owners' goal is to slow the growth of player salaries in relation 
to leaguewide revenue over the next three years, while the players 
want to keep earning as much as possible. 
 
As labor battles go, the current one between the National Basketball 
Association and its players is weird even by sports standards. There 
is a real possibility that most, if not all, of the coming season 
will be canceled. In this union battle it is the interests of the 
best paid, not those who make union scale, that are dominating the 
discussion. And here it is some of the workers, not the management, 
who are considering trying to make the union disappear. The current 
arrangement has produced an unbalanced pay scale of immense proportions. 
Last year more players than ever before received the union minimum, 
then $242,000 for rookies or $272,000 for veterans. The number of 
players making $1 million to $2 million a year _ the middle class, 
in NBA terms _ fell sharply. But Michael Jordan made $33 million. 
This should not be a surprise. Sports is an entertainment business, 
not unlike movies. Big stars get millions, while most get union scale. 
Over the years, NBA efforts to stem the rise of salaries have failed. 
The most important loophole in its salary cap lets a team sign its 
own free agent for whatever it is willing to pay. When that was adopted, 
it was assumed that no team would pay a lot more than a rival could 
pay. But it has not worked out that way. In the current negotiation, 
the league has offered to guarantee that its payroll will rise 20 
percent over the next four years, from $1 billion to $1.2 billion, 
and says it is open to proposals to split that money any way the players 
want, whether by raising the minimum salary or guaranteeing raises 
for veterans. The union says it is worried about that middle class, 
but seems determined to preserve the free market. The league got its 
broadcasters, NBC and Time Warner's cable channels, to agree to pay 
this year's television fees whether or not there are any games to 
broadcast. (They will be paid back in later years, either through 
reduced fees or extra games to show.) Owners hoped the players would 
think management was willing to wait them out, and come to terms with 
only a small part of the season canceled. But the union is acting 
unhurried. It turned aside requests for negotiations this week, saying 
the players had to meet first. Then there is the issue of union suicide, 
a tactic that was rejected by the players in 1995. The idea is that 
if the players had no union, it would be illegal under antitrust laws 
for the owners to collude. The sky would be the limit. That tactic 
might fail. The courts could reject a union decertification vote as 
a sham, and in any case some players may fear that teams would feel 
free to offer less than the old union minimum. But if the players 
go that route, it could be a long time before real negotiations get 
going. Billy Hunter, the union's executive director, warned the owners 
this week that a prolonged lockout could destroy the league's popularity. 
That was what all the seers said four years ago, when baseball's World 
Series was canceled by labor troubles. But fan memories are relatively 
short, and now baseball seems more popular than ever. With that in 
mind, both owners and players may choose to battle on for months. 
","In a dispute over a new collective bargaining agreement the National Basketball Association owners declared a lockout on July 1, 1998.
They wanted to discard a clause in the old agreement allowing teams to pay their own free agents whatever they wanted, substituting a hard salary cap.
The players wanted to keep earning as much as possible.
On Oct. 5 all 114 preseason games were cancelled.
The players then proposed a 50% tax on salaries above $18 million that the owners rejected.
On Oct. 13 the NBA cancelled the first two weeks of the regular season.
By Oct. 21 the entire season seemed in jeopardy in the interests of the best paid.
","Despite modest encouragement over a new proposal delivered by the 
players to the owners, the National Basketball Association Tuesday 
canceled the first two weeks of the regular season, the first time 
in the league's 51-year history that it will lose games to a labor 
dispute.NBA attorneys have indicated to the union that if the

and says it is open to proposals to split that money any way the players 
want, whether by raising the minimum salary or guaranteeing raises 
for veterans.Though many economic issues need to be resolved, the main point of 
contention since the labor agreement expired and the owners declared 
a lockout on July 1 has been a clause which allows teams to pay their 
own free agents whatever they want, regardless of salary-cap rules

More than 220 National Basketball Association players with guaranteed 
contracts will find out Monday whether they are to be paid during 
the management lockout, a long-awaited arbitrator's decision that 
may affect leverage in the league's dispute with the players and have 
major ramifications on American sports-labor law.Though many economic issues need to be resolved, the main point of 
contention since the labor agreement expired and the owners declared 
a lockout on July 1 has been a clause which allows teams to pay their 
own free agents whatever they want, regardless of salary-cap rules 
governing the NBA's 29 teams.He said it was his understanding 
when he negotiated the old labor agreement in 1995 that players would

More than 220 National Basketball Association players with guaranteed

canceled the first two weeks of the regular season, the first time 
in the league's 51-year history that it will lose games to a labor 
dispute.``We've got to get a sense 
of where the players are, what they consider to be reasonable and 
what they're willing to do in order to get the season to commence,'' 
Hunter said.``We've got to get a sense

the league has offered to guarantee that its payroll will rise 20 
percent over the next four years, from $1 billion to $1.2 billion, 
and says it is open to proposals to split that money any way the players 
want, whether by raising the minimum salary or guaranteeing raises 
for veterans.NBA attorneys have indicated to the union that if the 
decision goes against management, they will seek to have it vacated 
by appealing to the U.S. District Court in Manhattan and then, if 
necessary, to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a process that 
could prevent the players from getting paid for several months.The league also called former union 
director Simon Gourdine to testify, but Feerick upheld union objections 
and prohibited Gourdine from saying whether it was his understanding 
when he negotiated the old labor agreement in 1995 that players would 
not be paid if the owners chose to reopen the agreement and impose 
a lockout. 
 
Though many economic issues need to be resolved, the main point of 
contention since the labor agreement expired and the owners declared 
a lockout on July 1 has been a clause which allows teams to pay their 
own free agents whatever they want, regardless of salary-cap rules 
governing the NBA's 29 teams.He said it was his understanding

The decision to cancel 99 games between Nov. 
3 and Nov. 16 came after the players association proposed the implementation 
of a tax system instead of a hard salary cap, a proposal the owners 
said they would respond to by Friday.","``We've got to get a sense
