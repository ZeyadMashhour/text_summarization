       "\"\\nA Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast \\nfaces an uncertain future following the detention in Rome of its founder \\nand leader. Italian authorities captured Abdullah Ocalan at Rome's \\ninternational airport Thursday. Turkey has asked for his extradition \\nand Ocalan has asked for political asylum. Some believe that without \\nOcalan, who ruled some 10,000 loyal rebels with an iron fist, his \\nKurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, will be left in disarray. ``If the \\nhead is dethroned, the rebellion gets a mortal blow,'' said Cengiz \\nCandar who has been following the Kurdish insurgency for daily Sabah. \\nBut Ocalan has been absent from the battlefield for at least a month, \\nand others contend that the PKK is capable of operating without him. \\n``Let us not fall into false expectations that this will be the end \\nof the PKK. The PKK has already been acting like a headless monster \\nfor too long,'' said Ilnur Cevik of the English-language Turkish Daily \\nNews. Turkish newspapers have carried frequent reports of power struggles \\nwithin the PKK and said that Ocalan's grip on the PKK was beginning \\nto waver. Better known as Apo, Ocalan founded the Kurdistan Workers \\nParty, PKK, in 1978. The movement turned to armed struggle in 1984, \\nmainly focusing on guerrilla-style warfare in the southeast, but also \\ncarrying out bomb attacks on civilians in western Turkey. Close to \\n37,000 people died in the conflict. His presence in Europe could also \\nbe a blessing in disguise for the group, forcing the PKK to transform \\nitself from a rebel army into a political movement. Ocalan seemed \\nto be moving in this direction before his detention. While living \\nin Damacus, he increased his meetings with European deputies. This \\nmay be the PKK's best option. The Turkish military claims it has made \\nimportant battlefield gains and captured the PKK's second-in-command \\nthis year. The rebels also seem to have lost the support of Syria, \\nwhich appears to have forced Ocalan to leave after Turkey threatened \\nto attack it. Two Iraqi Kurdish groups controlling Turkey's border \\nwith Iraq have also grown lukewarm. The PKK has used their bases in \\nSyria and Iraq to wage cross-border operations. ``The PKK had two \\noptions. Either they choose to fight until they get control of the \\narea, regardless of what image they project abroad, or they try to \\ntake on a political image. I believe (Ocalan) wanted to leave the \\nMiddle East so he could become a political figure,'' said Hikmet Tavak, \\nmanaging director of the London-based Kurdish television, MED-TV. \\nIn Rome, spokesmen for the PKK said Ocalan had carefully selected \\nItaly because he felt there was sympathy there for his cause. They \\nalso said Italian authorities were warned that Ocalan would be arriving. \\nThere is a fair amount of sympathy for the Kurds in Europe, and if \\nthe movement gains political momentum, Turkey could come under more \\npressure from its western allies to grant the Kurds minority rights. \\nThere are an estimated 8 to 15 million Kurds in Turkey. They are not \\nrecognized as an official minority and barred from using Kurdish in \\neducation or broadcasting. Kurdish politicians have been jailed and \\ngroups banned on charges of supporting the PKK. \\n \\nTurkey stepped up the pressure on Italy for the extradition of captured \\nKurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, warning Sunday that granting \\nhim asylum would amount to ``opening doors to terrorism.'' In Rome, \\n1,500 Kurds massed for a second day of demonstrations outside the \\nmilitary hospital where Ocalan is believed to be held. Kurds arrived \\nfrom Germany and France to show solidarity with the rebel leader and \\na Kurdish group stopped at Rome's airport launched a hunger strike. \\nIf Italy sends the Kurd leader back to Turkey, ``he'll be tortured \\nfor certain,'' said Dino Frisullo, an Italian supporter among the \\nsinging, chanting Kurds outside the military hospital. ``And very \\npossibly he'll be killed.'' Ocalan was arrested at the Rome airport \\non Thursday as soon as he stepped off a plane from Moscow, where he \\nhad sought asylum after recently fleeing his hideout in Syria. He \\nleads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which has been fighting \\nfor Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. The conflict \\nhas killed nearly 37,000 people. Turkey considers Ocalan a terrorist \\nand its most-wanted criminal. ``If Western European nations open their \\narms (to the rebels) they will be taking on this great terrorism problem,'' \\nDeputy Premier Bulent Ecevit told reporters in Ankara. ``If Italy \\ncontinues to show the tolerance it showed yesterday it will be opening \\nits doors to terrorism,'' Ecevit added, referring to Italy's handling \\nof brawls that broke out among the Kurdish demonstrators in Rome on \\nSaturday. The protests were peaceful Sunday. Ocalan faces the death \\npenalty in Turkey, a fact that has heightened opposition in Italy \\nto his extradition. Although there have been no executions in Turkey \\nsince 1984, Italy has consistently refused to extradite anyone if \\nthere were even a risk of capital punishment. Foreign Minister Ismail \\nCem left for Rome on Sunday to attend a meeting of European defense \\nand foreign ministers. Before leaving, he criticized an Italian Justice \\nMinistry official, who reportedly said Turkey's extradition request \\nwould be refused. ``To announce the results of an extradition trial \\nthat has not yet even begun does not go hand in hand with justice,'' \\nCem told reporters. He said he would tell Italian Foreign Minister \\nLamberto Dini ``that we expect a serious and fair approach.'' Ocalan, \\na political science dropout from Ankara University, founded the Marxist-inspired \\nPKK in 1978. He turned the group toward armed struggle in 1984, finding \\nwide support among poor Kurds in the underdeveloped southeast. The \\nTurkish army claims to have all but wiped out the PKK within Turkey \\nbut the rebels have havens in Iran, Syria, and Iraq and the fighting \\ncontinues. \\n \\nTurkey stepped up pressure on Italy for the extradition of captured \\nKurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, saying Sunday that granting \\nhim asylum would amount to ``opening doors to terrorism.'' Kurds in \\nItaly, Germany, Austria and Romania launched protests and hunger strikes \\nin fervent shows of solidarity with the rebel leader. Kurds came to \\nRome by bus and car from across Western Europe for a 1,500-strong \\nprotest outside the military hospital where Ocalan is believed held \\nunder tight security. If Italy sends Ocalan back to Turkey, ``he'll \\nbe tortured for certain,'' said Dino Frisullo, an Italian supporter \\namong the singing, chanting Kurds outside the military hospital. ``And \\nvery possibly he'll be killed.'' Ocalan was arrested Thursday at the \\nRome airport as soon as he stepped off a plane from Moscow, where \\nhe had sought asylum after fleeing his hideout in Syria. He leads \\nthe outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which has been fighting \\nfor Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. The conflict \\nhas killed nearly 37,000 people. To Turkey, Ocalan is the nation's \\nmost-wanted criminal. ``If Western European nations open their arms \\n(to the rebels) they will be taking on this great terrorism problem,'' \\nDeputy Premier Bulent Ecevit told reporters in Ankara. ``If Italy \\ncontinues to show the tolerance it showed yesterday, it will be opening \\nits doors to terrorism,'' Ecevit added, referring to Italy's handling \\nof brawls that broke out during the first day of protests Saturday \\noutside the Rome military hospital. The protest in Rome was peaceful \\nSunday. Elsewhere in Europe, dozens of Kurds protested in Bucharest \\nuntil chased away by police; 1,000 Kurds rallied in Bonn, some waving \\npictures of the Kurd leader; and 100 Kurds in Vienna set up tents \\noutside Parliament and declared a hunger strike. In Turkey, four Kurdish \\nprison inmates were in critical condition after setting themselves \\non fire to protest Ocalan's arrest, the independent Human Rights Association \\nsaid. Ocalan faces the death penalty in Turkey, a fact that has heightened \\nopposition in Italy to his extradition. Although there have been no \\nexecutions in Turkey since 1984, Italy has consistently refused to \\nextradite anyone if there were even a risk of capital punishment. \\nForeign Minister Ismail Cem left for Rome on Sunday to attend a meeting \\nof European defense and foreign ministers, saying he would tell Italian \\nForeign Minister Lamberto Dini that ``we expect a serious and fair \\napproach.'' He criticized an Italian Justice Ministry official, who \\nreportedly said Italy would deny Turkey's extradition request. ``To \\nannounce the results of an extradition trial that has not yet even \\nbegun does not go hand in hand with justice,'' Cem told reporters \\nbefore departing. Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin indicated \\nto reporters in Rome that Italian companies could be shut out of Turkey's \\nbillions of dollars of defense contracts if it fails to turn over \\nthe Kurd. In Italy, Dini told reporters in the city of Trento that \\nthe government would decide Ocalan's request for asylum in a ``clear \\nand responsible manner.'' It was up for the courts to decide Turkey's \\nextradition request, as well as an expected one from Germany, he said. \\nIn Istanbul, Turkish inmates at a prison took an Italian prisoner \\nhostage to increase pressure for Ocalan's extradition. Metris prison \\nofficials said the jail director was talking to the inmate captors. \\nOcalan founded the Marxist-inspired PKK in 1978. He turned the group \\ntoward armed struggle in 1984, finding wide support among poor Kurds \\nin the underdeveloped southeast. The Turkish army claims to have all \\nbut wiped out the PKK within Turkey but the rebels have havens in \\nIran, Syria, and Iraq and the fighting continues. \\n \\nGreek media and officials leveled strong opposition Sunday to the \\npossible extradition of Abdullah Ocalan, the arrested Kurdish guerrilla \\nleader, to Greece's traditional rival Turkey. Ocalan, whose Kurdistan \\nWorkers Party has waged a 14-year war with Turkey for autonomy in \\nsoutheastern Turkey, is in prison custody in Rome where his arrest \\nwas announced Friday. ``We do not give advise to other countries,'' \\nsaid parliament speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis. ``Europe has a tradition \\nof civilization and human rights and I think as a rule it abides by \\nthat tradition.'' Greece has not officially responded to Ocalan's \\narrest, which was welcomed by the United States. But Greek government \\nofficials have stressed support for Kurdish self-determination. ``We \\nhave repeatedly brought attention to the problems created by the blatant \\nviolation of human rights in southeast Turkey,'' government spokesman \\nDimitris Reppas said late Saturday. In the past, Greece has accused \\nAnkara of waging a campaign of ``genocide'' against its Kurdish population. \\nAnkara counters that Greece is harboring PKK ``terrorists.'' Both \\nsides angrily deny the charges. Thousands of Kurdish refugees from \\nnorthern Iraq and Turkey have sought refuge in Greece. A group of \\nmore than 100 Kurds began a three-day fast in a downtown Athens square \\nSaturday in support of Ocalan. Within hours of the PKK leader's arrest, \\nTurkey requested his extradition to face a number of terrorism-related \\ncharges, which could carry the death penalty. ``Italy knows what the \\nfate of the Kurdish rebel will be if he falls into the hands of the \\nTurkish military regime,'' said an editorial Saturday in the Greek \\ndaily Eleftherotypia. ``Ocalan has requested political asylum in Italy \\nas head of the Kurdish liberation movement and should be allowed to \\nremain in a democratic country. He must not be extradited to Turkey.'' \\nGreece's Communist party and a small leftist opposition party called \\non the government to exercise its influence on Italy to keep Ocalan \\nthere. The move was also supported by a number of parliamentary deputies \\nfrom the governing Socialist party. Earlier this month, a bloc of \\n109 lawmakers in the 300-member parliament issued an invitation for \\nOcalan to visit Greece. \\n \\nAbout 1,500 Kurds who spent the night outside a military hospital \\nwhere Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan is believed held continued \\ntheir hunger strike Monday to protest his detention. Kurds from across \\nWestern Europe have been streaming into Rome to show their support \\nfor Ocalan (pronounced Oh-jah-lan), who was arrested Thursday when \\nhe stepped off a plane from Moscow. He had been seeking political \\nasylum in Russia after fleeing his hideout in Syria. He has, 3rd graf \\n \\nTurkish authorities negotiated with an imprisoned mob leader for a \\nsecond day Monday to secure the release of an Italian inmate held \\nhostage to pressure Italy into extraditing a Kurdish rebel leader, \\na prosecutor said. The Italian, Mario Calascibetta, was taken hostage \\nSunday by a group of inmates affiliated with mob leader Yasar Oz, \\nto push for the return to Turkey of rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, \\nTurkey's most-wanted man. Ocalan is currently being held in Rome. \\nCalascibetta, imprisoned in Istanbul's Metris jail since his detention \\nin August, was due to be handed over to Swiss police Monday. He is \\nwanted for questioning in Switzerland in connection with a killing. \\nTurkey's Anatolia news agency said Oz was determined not to free his \\nhostage until Italy agreed to Turkey's demand to send back Ocalan \\nwho is Turkey's most wanted man. ``He is not in any life threatening \\ndanger. We are not alarmed for his safety,'' said prosecutor Celil \\nDemircioglu. ``The negotiations are continuing, we believe he will \\nbe freed very soon.'' Demircioglu said Calascibetta's extradition \\nwould now be delayed by a few days. He denied Turkish press reports \\nthat the Italian was being held at gun point. Oz is currently on trial \\non drugs-related charges. The mob has often supported right-wing parties \\nand ultranationalist causes. At a time when the state is under pressure \\nto crack down on the mob, it seemed convenient for Oz to show he was \\nbacking the government's cause. \\n \\nINNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) -- Italian authorities have turned back at \\nleast 136 people along the Austro-Italian border during an immigration \\ncrackdown prompted by the arrest of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, \\nAustrian officials said Monday. Most of those sent back since the \\ncrackdown began Saturday were refused entry into Italy because they \\nhad no visas or residence permits, the Austrians said. On Monday alone, \\nabout 70 people were refused entry at the Brenner Pass crossing point. \\nThey included Pakistanis, Indians, Yugoslavs and Chinese as well as \\nKurds, the Austrians said. The border crackdown appeared designed \\nto prevent large numbers of Kurds living in Western Europe from flocking \\nto Rome for protests in connection with Ocalan's arrest. Turkey has \\nasked for Ocalan's extradition. Austrian authorities said many of \\nthose turned back had come from Germany. A Red Cross station was set \\nup at the border to assist those turned away to return to Germany \\nif their residence permits were in order. Those without proper papers \\nwere detained by Austrian immigration. \\n \\nThousands of Kurds living in Romania closed down restaurants, shops \\nand companies to protest the arrest of leader Abdullah Ocalan by Italian \\nauthorities, a newspaper reported Tuesday. Kurdish business leaders \\nsaid the one-day shutdown Monday cost their 1,000 businesses some \\ndlrs 700,000, daily Evenimentul Zilei reported. There are some 4,000 \\nKurds living in Romania. Kurdish students cut classes and workers \\ndidn't go to work. Some 41 Kurds declared a hunger strike Monday to \\nprotest Ocalan's detention. The protesters have refused any medical \\nassistance from Romanian authorities, relying on the services of two \\nKurdish doctors, the paper reported. ``We are not terrorists, as we \\nare considered by the Turkish state and its friends,'' said Aihan \\nDogan, a Kurdish leader. The detention in Italy of Kurdish rebel leader \\nOcalan prompted widespread protests by Kurds throughout Europe. Turkey \\nhas asked for Ocalan to be returned to Turkey. \\n \\nAbout 1,000 policemen were assigned to protect Turkish President Suleyman \\nDemirel, who arrived Tuesday on a three-day official visit. President \\nThomas Klestil's invitation for the visit was issued to take place \\nduring Austria's European Union presidency. Austrian government officials \\nreportedly will try to open up a ``longer-term perspective'' for Turkey's \\nEU membership. A related topic certain to come up is Cyprus, among \\nsix countries with whom the European Union started formal membership \\ntalks on Nov. 10. In a rare joint statement, the Netherlands, Germany \\nand France said the inability of Greek and Turkish Cypriots to reconcile \\ntheir differences weighed heavily on their island's membership chances. \\nThey spoke of ``fundamental problems'' in the Cyprus negotiating process, \\nadding ``a political solution is urgently required.'' Austrian police \\ntook special measures to ensure the safety of the Turkish visitor. \\n``The political situation requires comprehensive security measures,'' \\nthe Austria Press Agency quoted Walter Zehetmayr, a senior police \\nofficer, as saying. The extra effort was prompted by the arrest last \\nweek in Rome of Abdullah Ocalan, the chief of the Turkish Workers \\nParty PKK, Zehetmayr said. He hinted that he expects large protests \\nof Turkish groups in Vienna. Demirel, who was accompanied by five \\nCabinet members and a large trade delegation, is the first head of \\nstate of the Turkish Republic to visit Austria, APA said. Following \\nhis talks with Klestil and a luncheon in the president's residence, \\nDemirel was scheduled to meet Parliament president Heinz Fischer and \\nother senior officials. He was also to deliver a speech to the Foreign \\nPolicy Society later Tuesday. \\n \\nFacing his first real foreign policy test, Prime Minister Massimo \\nD'Alema must decide what to do with a prominent Kurdish rebel leader \\nwho was arrested at the Rome airport on Thursday. Turkey wants Italy \\nto extradite the rebel, Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers' \\nParty, which is seeking Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey. He \\nis viewed in Turkey as a terrorist. Germany also has a warrant out \\nfor his arrest on homicide charges. But D'Alema, a former Communist \\nwho was appointed prime minister last month, is under pressure from \\nleftists in his coalition to offer Ocalan political asylum. In a news \\nconference Monday, D'Alema recognized the extent of the problem. ``The \\nlast thing we wanted was an awkward and complicated situation like \\nthis one,'' he said. He noted that Italian law prohibits extradition \\nof suspects to countries that have the death penalty. Turkey has capital \\npunishment, though it says it will soon abolish it. Ocalan is being \\ntried in absentia there on charges that could bring the death penalty. \\nD'Alema said a committee in the Interior Ministry would determine \\nwhether Ocalan would qualify for political asylum, which would be \\npossible if Ocalan's promise to renounce terrorism, issued Monday, \\nholds up. ``We do not want someone who organizes terrorism in Italy,'' \\nD'Alema said. ``This is an opportunity to find an exit from a bloody \\nconflict.'' Earlier Monday, while members of D'Alema's government \\nmet with Turkish officials who were in Rome for a European ministerial \\nmeeting, thousands of Kurds flooded into Rome to hold a demonstration \\nand hunger strike in support of Ocalan. D'Alema's decision was further \\ncomplicated on Sunday when Turkish inmates in a prison in Istanbul \\ntook an Italian prisoner hostage, saying they would release him only \\nafter Italy extradited Ocalan. Monday, D'Alema said he would not bow \\nto pressure. \\n\""

Ocalan, whose Kurdistan \\r\\nWorkers Party has waged a 14-year war with Turkey for autonomy in \\r\\nsoutheastern Turkey, is in prison custody in Rome where his arrest \\r\\nwas announced Friday. ``We do not give advise to other countries,'' \\r\\nsaid parliament speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis. ``Europe has a tradition \\r\\nof civilization and human rights and I think as a rule it abides by \\r\\nthat tradition.'' Greece has not officially responded to Ocalan's \\r\\narrest, which was welcomed by the United States. But Greek government \\r\\nofficials have stressed support for Kurdish self-determination. ``We \\r\\nhave repeatedly brought attention to the problems created by the blatant \\r\\nviolation of human rights in southeast Turkey,'' government spokesman \\r\\nDimitris Reppas said late Saturday. In the past, Greece has accused \\r\\nAnkara of waging a campaign of ``genocide'' against its Kurdish population. \\r\\nAnkara counters that Greece is harboring PKK ``terrorists.'' Both \\r\\nsides angrily deny the charges. Thousands of Kurdish refugees from \\r\\nnorthern Iraq and Turkey have sought refuge in Greece. A group of \\r\\nmore than 100 Kurds began a three-day fast in a downtown Athens square \\r\\nSaturday in support of Ocalan. Within hours of the PKK leader's arrest, \\r\\nTurkey requested his extradition to face a number of terrorism-related \\r\\ncharges, which could carry the death penalty. ``Italy knows what the \\r\\nfate of the Kurdish rebel will be if he falls into the hands of the \\r\\nTurkish military regime,'' said an editorial Saturday in the Greek \\r\\ndaily Eleftherotypia. ``Ocalan has requested political asylum in Italy \\r\\nas head of the Kurdish liberation movement and should be allowed to \\r\\nremain in a democratic country. He must not be extradited to Turkey.'' \\r\\nGreece's Communist party and a small leftist opposition party called \\r\\non the government to exercise its influence on Italy to keep Ocalan \\r\\nthere. The move was also supported by a number of parliamentary deputies \\r\\nfrom the governing Socialist party. Earlier this month, a bloc of \\r\\n109 lawmakers in the 300-member parliament issued an invitation for \\r\\nOcalan to visit Greece. \\r\\n \\r\\nAbout 1,500 Kurds who spent the night outside a military hospital \\r\\nwhere Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan is believed held continued \\r\\ntheir hunger strike Monday to protest his detention. Kurds from across \\r\\nWestern Europe have been streaming into Rome to show their support \\r\\nfor Ocalan (pronounced Oh-jah-lan), who was arrested Thursday when \\r\\nhe stepped off a plane from Moscow. He had been seeking political \\r\\nasylum in Russia after fleeing his hideout in Syria. He has, 3rd graf \\r\\n \\r\\nTurkish authorities negotiated with an imprisoned mob leader for a \\r\\nsecond day Monday to secure the release of an Italian inmate held \\r\\nhostage to pressure Italy into extraditing a Kurdish rebel leader, \\r\\na prosecutor said. The Italian, Mario Calascibetta, was taken hostage \\r\\nSunday by a group of inmates affiliated with mob leader Yasar Oz, \\r\\nto push for the return to Turkey of rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, \\r\\nTurkey's most-wanted man. Ocalan is currently being held in Rome. \\r\\nCalascibetta, imprisoned in Istanbul's Metris jail since his detention \\r\\nin August, was due to be handed over to Swiss police Monday. He is \\r\\nwanted for questioning in Switzerland in connection with a killing. \\r\\nTurkey's Anatolia news agency said Oz was determined not to free his \\r\\nhostage until Italy agreed to Turkey's demand to send back Ocalan \\r\\nwho is Turkey's most wanted man. ``He is not in any life threatening \\r\\ndanger. We are not alarmed for his safety,'' said prosecutor Celil \\r\\nDemircioglu. ``The negotiations are continuing, we believe he will \\r\\nbe freed very soon.'' Demircioglu said Calascibetta's extradition \\r\\nwould now be delayed by a few days. He denied Turkish press reports \\r\\nthat the Italian was being held at gun point. Oz is currently on trial \\r\\non drugs-related charges. The mob has often supported right-wing parties \\r\\nand ultranationalist causes. At a time when the state is under pressure \\r\\nto crack down on the mob, it seemed convenient for Oz to show he was \\r\\nbacking the government's cause. \\r\\n \\r\\nINNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) -- Italian authorities have turned back at \\r\\nleast 136 people along the Austro-Italian border during an immigration \\r\\ncrackdown prompted by the arrest of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, \\r\\nAustrian officials said Monday. Most of those sent back since the \\r\\ncrackdown began Saturday were refused entry into Italy because they \\r\\nhad no visas or residence permits, the Austrians said. On Monday alone, \\r\\nabout 70 people were refused entry at the Brenner Pass crossing point. \\r\\nThey included Pakistanis, Indians, Yugoslavs and Chinese as well as \\r\\nKurds, the Austrians said. The border crackdown appeared designed \\r\\nto prevent large numbers of Kurds living in Western Europe from flocking \\r\\nto Rome for protests in connection with Ocalan's arrest. Turkey has \\r\\nasked for Ocalan's extradition. Austrian authorities said many of \\r\\nthose turned back had come from Germany. A Red Cross station was set \\r\\nup at the border to assist those turned away to return to Germany \\r\\nif their residence permits were in order. Those without proper papers \\r\\nwere detained by Austrian immigration. \\r\\n \\r\\nThousands of Kurds living in Romania closed down restaurants, shops \\r\\nand companies to protest the arrest of leader Abdullah Ocalan by Italian \\r\\nauthorities, a newspaper reported Tuesday. Kurdish business leaders \\r\\nsaid the one-day shutdown Monday cost their 1,000 businesses some \\r\\ndlrs 700,000, daily Evenimentul Zilei reported. There are some 4,000 \\r\\nKurds living in Romania. Kurdish students cut classes and workers \\r\\ndidn't go to work. Some 41 Kurds declared a hunger strike Monday to \\r\\nprotest Ocalan's detention. The protesters have refused any medical \\r\\nassistance from Romanian authorities, relying on the services of two \\r\\nKurdish doctors, the paper reported. ``We are not terrorists, as we \\r\\nare considered by the Turkish state and its friends,'' said Aihan \\r\\nDogan, a Kurdish leader. The detention in Italy of Kurdish rebel leader \\r\\nOcalan prompted widespread protests by Kurds throughout Europe. Turkey \\r\\nhas asked for Ocalan to be returned to Turkey. \\r\\n \\r\\nAbout 1,000 policemen were assigned to protect Turkish President Suleyman \\r\\nDemirel, who arrived Tuesday on a three-day official visit. President \\r\\nThomas Klestil's invitation for the visit was issued to take place \\r\\nduring Austria's European Union presidency. Austrian government officials \\r\\nreportedly will try to open up a ``longer-term perspective'' for Turkey's \\r\\nEU membership. A related topic certain to come up is Cyprus, among \\r\\nsix countries with whom the European Union started formal membership \\r\\ntalks on Nov. 10. In a rare joint statement, the Netherlands, Germany \\r\\nand France said the inability of Greek and Turkish Cypriots to reconcile \\r\\ntheir differences weighed heavily on their island's membership chances. \\r\\nThey spoke of ``fundamental problems'' in the Cyprus negotiating process, \\r\\nadding ``a political solution is urgently required.'' Austrian police \\r\\ntook special measures to ensure the safety of the Turkish visitor. \\r\\n``The political situation requires comprehensive security measures,'' \\r\\nthe Austria Press Agency quoted Walter Zehetmayr, a senior police \\r\\nofficer, as saying. The extra effort was prompted by the arrest last \\r\\nweek in Rome of Abdullah Ocalan, the chief of the Turkish Workers \\r\\nParty PKK, Zehetmayr said. He hinted that he expects large protests \\r\\nof Turkish groups in Vienna. Demirel, who was accompanied by five \\r\\nCabinet members and a large trade delegation, is the first head of \\r\\nstate of the Turkish Republic to visit Austria, APA said. Following \\r\\nhis talks with Klestil and a luncheon in the president's residence, \\r\\nDemirel was scheduled to meet Parliament president Heinz Fischer and \\r\\nother senior officials. He was also to deliver a speech to the Foreign \\r\\nPolicy Society later Tuesday. \\r\\n \\r\\nFacing his first real foreign policy test, Prime Minister Massimo \\r\\nD'Alema must decide what to do with a prominent Kurdish rebel leader \\r\\nwho was arrested at the Rome airport on Thursday. Turkey wants Italy \\r\\nto extradite the rebel, Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers' \\r\\nParty, which is seeking Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey. He \\r\\nis viewed in Turkey as a terrorist. Germany also has a warrant out \\r\\nfor his arrest on homicide charges. But D'Alema, a former Communist \\r\\nwho was appointed prime minister last month, is under pressure from \\r\\nleftists in his coalition to offer Ocalan political asylum. In a news \\r\\nconference Monday, D'Alema recognized the extent of the problem. ``The \\r\\nlast thing we wanted was an awkward and complicated situation like \\r\\nthis one,'' he said. He noted that Italian law prohibits extradition \\r\\nof suspects to countries that have the death penalty. Turkey has capital \\r\\npunishment, though it says it will soon abolish it. Ocalan is being \\r\\ntried in absentia there on charges that could bring the death penalty. \\r\\nD'Alema said a committee in the Interior Ministry would determine \\r\\nwhether Ocalan would qualify for political asylum, which would be \\r\\npossible if Ocalan's promise to renounce terrorism, issued Monday, \\r\\nholds up. ``We do not want someone who organizes terrorism in Italy,'' \\r\\nD'Alema said. ``This is an opportunity to find an exit from a bloody \\r\\nconflict.'' Earlier Monday, while members of D'Alema's government \\r\\nmet with Turkish officials who were in Rome for a European ministerial \\r\\nmeeting, thousands of Kurds flooded into Rome to hold a demonstration \\r\\nand hunger strike in support of Ocalan. D'Alema's decision was further \\r\\ncomplicated on Sunday when Turkish inmates in a prison in Istanbul \\r\\ntook an Italian prisoner hostage, saying they would release him only \\r\\nafter Italy extradited Ocalan. Monday, D'Alema said he would not bow \\r\\nto pressure. \\r\\n\""

       "\"The deal, which will make Hun Sen \\nprime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended \\nmore than three months of political deadlock that followed a July \\nelection narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation \\nof a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President \\nChea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding \\nresolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives \\ncalling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian \\nlaw allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution \\ninclude Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince \\nNorodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against \\nanti-government demonstrations.Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, \\nopposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of \\nsecurity guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote \\nin a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the \\nfirst session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained \\nthat Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns \\nhis party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.``No party with \\nseats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency \\nand a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the \\nstatement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given \\nchairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely \\nand realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice \\nto the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' \\nthe party said in a statement.The senior Senate leaders will join \\nthose of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two \\nBuddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that \\nwill choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.\""
