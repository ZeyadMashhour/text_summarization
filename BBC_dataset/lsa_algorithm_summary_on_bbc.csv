Quarterly profits at US media giant TimeWarner jumped 76% to $1.13bn (Â£600m) for the three months to December, from $639m year-earlier.

But its film division saw profits slump 27% to $284m, helped by box-office flops Alexander and Catwoman, a sharp contrast to year-earlier, when the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy boosted results.Its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset a profit dip at Warner Bros, and less users for AOL.

1,"Dollar gains on Greenspan speech

The dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the Federal Reserve head said the US trade deficit is set to stabilise.

In the meantime, the US Federal Reserve's decision on 2 February to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with European rates.The half-point window, some believe, could be enough to keep US assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar.On Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Greenspan's speech in London ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected US jobs data.In late trading in New York, the dollar reached $1.2871 against the euro, from $1.2974 on Thursday.The White House will announce its budget on Monday, and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars.
And Alan Greenspan highlighted the US government's willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it."

Yukos unit buyer faces loan claim

Yukos had filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm.Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky and has vowed to sue any participant in the sale.
Rosneft already faces a similar $540m repayment demand from foreign banks.Menatep Group's managing director Tim Osborne told the Reuters news agency: ""If they default, we will fight them where the rule of law exists under the international arbitration clauses of the credit.Yukos' owner Menatep Group says it will ask Rosneft to repay a loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets."

""For the year to March 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated,"" BA chairman Martin Broughton said.BA's profits were still better than market expectation of Â£59m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues.

""For example, we have taken delivery of six Airbus A321 aircraft and next month we will start further improvements to our Club World flat beds.""Looking ahead to its full year results to March 2005, BA warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers.Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, BA has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive."

Shares in UK drinks and food firm Allied Domecq have risen on speculation that it could be the target of a takeover by France's Pernod Ricard.

In terms of market value, Pernod - at 7.5bn euros ($9.7bn) - is about 9% smaller than Allied Domecq, which has a capitalisation of Â£5.7bn ($10.7bn; 8.2bn euros).Pernod said it was seeking acquisitions but refused to comment on specifics.

The WSJ said that the two were ripe for consolidation, having each dealt with problematic parts of their portfolio.Reports in the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times suggested that the French spirits firm is considering a bid, but has yet to contact its target.Pernod has reduced the debt it took on to fund the Seagram purchase to just 1.8bn euros, while Allied has improved the performance of its fast-food chains.

Ethiopia produced 14.27 million tonnes of crops in 2004, 24% higher than in 2003 and 21% more than the average of the past five years, a report says.

In eastern and southern Ethiopia, a prolonged drought has killed crops and drained wells.In 2003, crop production totalled 11.49 million tonnes, the joint report from the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Food Programme said.Agriculture is the main economic activity in Ethiopia, representing 45% of gross domestic product.Good rains, increased use of fertilizers and improved seeds contributed to the rise in production.The report calculated emergency food requirements for 2005 to be 387,500 tonnes.On top of that, 89,000 tonnes of fortified blended food and vegetable oil for ""targeted supplementary food distributions for a survival programme for children under five and pregnant and lactating women"" will be needed.

The tobacco companies deny that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public.Court rejects $280bn tobacco case

A US government claim accusing the country's biggest tobacco companies of covering up the effects of smoking has been thrown out by an appeal court.

In its case, the government claimed tobacco firms manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction, targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns, lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary.

The court in Washington found that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws.Prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to surrender $280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products."

In both cases, their shares fell by some 4%.Neither Ask Jeeves nor Doubleclick thrilled investors with their profit news, however.The firm's revenue nearly tripled in the fourth quarter of 2004, exceeding $86m (Â£46m).The trend has taken hold relatively quickly."

Since President Yudhoyono's government came to power in October, it has indicated its intention of raising domestic fuel prices by cutting subsidies.It spent 59.2 trillion rupiah ($6.58bn; Â£3.5bn) on fuel subsidies in 2004, a sum far in excess of its original projection of 14.5 trillion rupiah.The sooner the better for the state budget.""Indonesia pays subsidies to importers in order to stabilise domestic fuel prices, but higher oil prices have forced the government to spend more on holding prices down."

On Wednesday, Jacques Barrot, vice president of the European Commission and also Commissioner for Transport, said that the changes were necessary.The ERAA's Mr Clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules, the extra costs would be passed onto passengers.Andy Clarke, ERAA director of air transport, said that the EC advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.

Airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost."
15,"China keeps tight rein on credit

China's efforts to stop the economy from overheating by clamping down on credit will continue into 2005, state media report.

To some extent, the credit controls do seem to be taking effect.In theory, the government has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a ""hard landing"" in the shape of an overbalancing economy.A low exchange rate - China's yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar, which seems to be in relentless decline - means Chinese exports are cheap on world markets.China has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg.Rapid tooling-up of China's manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year.There were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system."

19,"However, companies that decide to ""offshore"" their operations are driven not just by cost considerations.They give three key reasons for not making the move:

- call centre operations are part of their business ""core function"", 
 - they are worried about the risk of going abroad, 
 - they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive.This, Ms Diemont warns, is ""scary"" and not good for the bottom line either.Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres.Only 42% of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations.Suggestions that ""outsourcing"" - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like India or South Africa - is to blame are wrong, Ms Diemont says.

If confirmed, that would be the best quarterly showing since early 2002.Despite the apparent shortfall in annual economic growth, the good quarterly figures - a so-called ""flash estimate"" - mark a continuing trend of improving indicators for the health of the French economy.""The numbers are good,"" said David Naude, economist at Deutsche Bank."
23,"But others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets, which may in turn harm growth.Imports were not affected by the dollar's weakness last year.""We expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend,"" said economist Marie-Pierre Ripert at IXIS.
The US consumer's appetite for all things from oil to imported cars, and even wine and cheese, reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of President Bush's economic policies.

Some economists say this may allow an upward revision of US economic growth in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, the Bush administration argues that the US deficit reflects the fact the America is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world, spurring on more demand for imported goods.The deficit with China, up 30.5% at $162bn, was the largest ever recorded with a single country."

On top of that, ongoing problems for beleaguered Russian oil giant Yukos have also prompted the IEA to revise its output estimates from Russia - a major non-Opec supplier.The Paris-based IEA watchdog, which advises industrialized nations on energy policy, said the upward revision was due to stronger demand from China and other Asian countries."

Controversial reforms passed in 2001 give the government the right to take control of private property if it is declared idle or ownership cannot be traced back to the 19th Century.

The government is cracking down on so-called latifundios, or large rural estates, which it says are lying idle.Critics say the powers - which President Chavez argues are needed to help the country's poorest citizens and develop the Venezuelan economy - trample all over private property rights.The company pointed out that the farm, which employs 300 workers, provides meat solely for the Venezuelan market.

Chris Curry, PPI research director, said its calculations suggested there could be more pressure on state pension spending than originally envisaged.The Pensions Policy Institute (PPI) said life expectancy for unskilled and professional men has been understated.The government has ruled out raising the state pension age, because it says it would penalise lower-skilled workers who generally have lower life expectancies.""Even people in social class V [unskilled manual workers] who are widely likely to have the lowest life expectancy can still expect to live 16 years after state pension age,"" he said.The PPI's estimate is higher because it excludes people who have died before they reach 65 years of age and also takes into account ongoing improvements in life expectancy.

If a May election is called, there could be as little as 18 days between the Budget and the announcement of a date for the election.The Budget, likely to be the last before the General Election, will be at 1230 GMT on that Wednesday, just after Prime Minister's question time.The annual event is when the chancellor outlines the government's taxation and broader economic predictions.The full Finance Bill, with the Budget measures in it, would then be returned to the Commons after the election, if Labour secures another term in office.A shortened Finance Bill would have to be rushed through Parliament with all-party support to allow the Government to continue collecting revenue."

But the UN refugees agency is worried the policy sends the wrong message to poorer countries which receive the bulk of refugees.The Tories also want quotas for those seeking work permits through an Australian-style points system and those wanting to join families in the UK.

He accused Mr Blair's government of ""being less than straightforward"" over its plans.""There is some truth in that, especially after the initial mistakes that were made - the heavy-handedness of operations like Fallujah, and the well-publicised instances of abuse at the hands of coalition forces.""""There are some who are of the opinion that the mere presence of British and American troops in Iraq feeds the insurgency,"" he said.Mr Kennedy pointed out that the Netherlands, Portugal and the Czech Republic, which all have troops operating in the southern sector of Iraq, have announced their imminent withdrawal ""regardless of the situation on the ground"".

If Wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more MPs.The number of Welsh MPs would be set at an amount that was ""consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the United Kingdom"" if the assembly was scrapped.The precise number of MPs to go would depend on the result of the Welsh referendum, but it would probably mean a reduction of around 120 from the current total of 659.Tories 'would cut number of MPs'

Mr Howard said the plan would also even out the ""great unfairness"" of there being proportionately more Scottish and Welsh MPs at Westminster than those from England.In Northern Ireland it was just over 66,000, in Wales just over 59,000 and in Scotland 53,000."

The BBC's home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford, said it appeared Mr Clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor, David Blunkett.The government was told that using anti-terror legislation brought in after 11 September to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws.

""Deportation may tackle this initial problem but I want to see a wider debate urgently about how we can actually get trials and convictions in this country.""The move follows a Law Lords judgement that the detention of 12 men at Belmarsh prison, London, and Woodhill, Milton Keynes, was unlawful."

A British terror suspect held in Guantanamo Bay for 33 months plans to sue the government, it is reported.

The US government denied the claims, saying it condemned and prohibited torture.Mr Mubanga said the man, and an American female defence official, tried to recruit him as an agent, but he refused and within three weeks was told he would be sent to Guantanamo Bay.

His lawyer Louise Christian said: ""'We are hoping to issue proceedings for the misfeasance of officials who colluded with the Americans in effectively kidnapping him and taking him to Guantanamo.""The real problem is the concentration camp conditions in Guantanamo.And Home Secretary Charles Clarke told BBC One's Breakfast with Frost: ""I'm not organising a specific investigation into it."""

Ministers had hoped to get Â£900m from the European Union Vet Fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted Â£349m. That was because the UK had valued the culled animals at between ""two and three times"" the commission's assessment of their likely market value.National Audit Office chief Sir John Bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at.That comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry.A Defra spokesman said: ""We welcome the report."

The plan was to ensure offenders were monitored by the same body during and after prison, preventing many from being lost in the system and helping more of them to stop reoffending.

The National Correctional Agency would have provided a 'one-stop' justice system but has been abandoned in the wake of stiff opposition.However, following a consultation on the idea, Justice Minister Cathy Jamieson has decided to drop the plans.A national advisory board on offender management will also be created to advise Ms Jamieson on the SPS's role and performance in reducing reoffending.She will announce the move in her Criminal Justice Plan on Monday, aiming to ""break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community"".Scotland's reoffending rate is high, with more than 60% of prisoners reconvicted within two years of release from jail."

If there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of Labour MPs it is the prospect of losing their seats at a general election.

As Paul Flynn said: ""What has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times, when we wanted to come together, we wanted to lead on the global issues, to change politics for the next decade, the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party, two people we greatly respect.""

Stephen Pound echoed the message, saying: ""We know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve, not for the Labour Party but for this country, is the appearance of division.The views expressed by both backbenchers and Labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely-held view within the Labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election.It is a sentiment that is now running throughout the Labour benches with MPs eager to underline the message to their leaders to stop the squabbling and get on with the job at hand.

They backed the suggestion that unless the squabbling stopped, the people briefing on behalf of the two men would be ""named and shamed"".And he is expected to repeat his recent insistence that the next manifesto will be ""New"" Labour through and through.Secondly it has also underlined the view that the election campaign has, to all intents and purposes, kicked off."

1155,"Labour seeks to quell feud talk

Labour's leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after MPs criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown over reports of their rift.

Mr Brown was joined at the launch by John Prescott and Alan Milburn, the man controversially put in charge of election planning by Mr Blair.Mr Milburn promised a poll campaign ""which is upbeat, confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country"".

The event was the first time Mr Milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking Mr Brown's traditional poll planning role.But the pair chatted amicably and Mr Brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task.Labour's Paul Flynn said the pair had had a ""scorching"" from MPs.

Conservative co-chairman Liam Fox derided the photo call, saying: ""The show of unity was the worst acting I have seen since Prisoner Cell Block H."" Labour had broken promises by raising taxes 66 times and brought the slowest economic growth in the English-speaking world, he said.

"
1156,"The event was carefully stage-managed to underline Cabinet unity.The event - at Old Billingsgate Fish Market on the banks of the Thames - was a carefully choreographed show of unity.But it was Mr Milburn who took centre stage, speaking of the ""positive campaign"" the party hoped to stage in the ""coming weeks and months"".

The event may have been designed to highlight Labour's economic success under Mr Brown, but there was little doubt who was in charge.As the side-door slid open, it looked for one glorious moment as if the Cabinet had decided to bury their differences and go on the road together, Scooby Doo-style.The chancellor walked side-by-side with Mr Milburn, pointedly exchanging chit chat, as they approached the microphone.But, sadly, it wasn't the Cabinet who had raided the dressing-up box - just six rather ill-at-ease looking Labour students."

Tony Blair's feud with Gordon Brown is damaging the way the UK is governed, Tory leader Michael Howard has claimed in a heated prime minister's questions.

"
1158,"Their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on.In the case of an apparently endless argument, if you want it to come to an end, you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row.Each participant genuinely wants the row to stop, but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard.The key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they'd be better off if it ended - but everyone wants to have the last word.

(In the case of Mr Blair and Mr Brown, successive books are published, ensuring the issues never die.)And there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going.Every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments, solutions which affect the incentives of the participants."

Tony Blair's big speech will be looked back on as the performance that kicked off the election campaign.

With an election looming the next big speech from Gordon Brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and, in particular, the use of that little three letter word.And for many in Westminster, Mr Blair's performance has only succeeded in hardening the belief that will be on 5 May.
There was an attempt to draw the line under the gossip surrounding his rift with Chancellor Gordon Brown.But for now, all eyes have been focused on the next general election.That poll may still be about 16 weeks away, but there can be little doubt left that the campaign is now in full swing.That might get under the skin of Mr Brown, but he also heaped praise on him as the most successful post-war chancellor Britain has had."

He called it his ""masochism strategy"" in the run-up to the Iraq war and now Tony Blair has signed up for another dose of pain.

Tony Blair himself has said people complain he does not listen.Mr Blair told prospective Labour MPs on Thursday that taking part in phone-ins and public meetings could ""enthuse and engage and give the public a sense of empowerment"".Mr Blair recalls how Bill Clinton once advised him: ""Always remember that what people see of you in the news in the evening is how they think you spend your day.""It is also the most effective way of showing that he is aware of real people's concerns and - on occasions - of their outright fury.""All you do is walk around and make yourself known, you don't do anything to help anybody,"" she told Mr Blair before stomping off, refusing his pleas to discuss the issue privately."

Brown names 16 March for Budget

Chancellor Gordon Brown will deliver his Budget to the House of Commons on 16 March, the Treasury has announced.

"
1250,"Mr Cable said people did not know whether to believe the chancellor or the consensus among experts which said the rule would be broken.Mr Cable also accused the chancellor of ducking tough choices.Mr Brown confirmed he was setting aside another Â£520m for the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.""We cannot have a continuation of a situation where the chancellor sets his own tests and then marks them.In his report, Mr Brown insisted he was on course to meet his ""golden rule"" of borrowing only to invest, rather than for day-to-day spending, over the course of the economic cycle.Mr Cable compared that new cost with the Â£500m needed for Britain's role in the entire first Gulf War - when 80% of the bill had been met through help from European and Arab nations.Instead, what was needed was simple and fair taxation rather than the ""complete mess"" produced by Mr Brown's endless tinkering.

"
1251,"David Page, of Investec Securities, said: ""His forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of Â£8bn is way too optimistic.Mr Brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises.

Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, called on Mr Brown to open up the government's books to the National Audit Office, to see if he had met his ""golden rule"".Many believe the figure is more likely to be under 3% - and fear tax rises or spending cuts, saying tax receipts have been overestimated.""It is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending,"" Mr Cable told MPs.
""It's going to take a significant turnaround in the economy to meet these targets.Mr Brown insisted his spending plans were ""affordable"" and he could afford to be optimistic because Britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising."
1252,"Mr Raynsford said he had held some ""pretty frank discussions"" with fellow ministers over the plans.""Obviously we had some pretty frank discussions about this,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One.These would raise the age from which retiring workers could claim their pensions and limit how much they received if they retired early.He insisted the changes were ""very modest"" and designed to tackle the problem of workers retiring ""very early"".Mr Raynsford also plans to make savings of Â£100m by making changes to local government pensions schemes.Mr Raynsford dismissed a suggestion the move was designed to keep council taxes down ahead of an expected general election.

But general secretary of the public services union Unison Dave Prentis criticised the plans."

The wrangling could stretch into 2005, even 2006.

But if you are going to anywhere, just add something to the competitiveness of Britain, put it into skilling our people'.""That would be a good way to spend any excess.Stability is the key word - British business needs boring stability more than anything.""I don't think we'll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001,"" he said.

"
1255,"The Liberal Democrats will also promise to run a sound economy, but based on increased taxes to fund spending and, amongst other things, abolishing the council tax in favour of a local income tax.The opposition will reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound, increase spending and cut taxes at the same time.

Previous gloomy forecasts proved wrong, he will argue, while suggesting that only by sticking with him can Britain continue to have a sound economy, low unemployment and high public spending.The opening shot in that battle was fired at the weekend with claims a Treasury leak suggested Mr Brown was ready to slap capital gains tax on home sales to raise some of that cash.There will be plenty of talk about taking no risks with the economy or handing out irresponsible giveaways.And there has already been speculation about possible tax reductions for the poorest and increasing the threshold on stamp duty in this week's Budget.Mr Brown will undoubtedly claim the forecasts are simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise taxes after the election, should Labour win."
1256,"The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power.But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.

Budget to set scene for election

Gordon Brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of Labour's bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth Budget at 1230 GMT.""If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around Â£10bn.""

For the Lib Dems David Laws said: ""The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,"" he said.The Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a ""classic Labour stealth tax"".Treasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about Â£2bn to spare.

"
1257,"He did it most obviously with his increase in national insurance contributions after the 2001 election campaign during which he had pledged not to increase income tax.As Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy claimed, for most families the distinction between income tax and a tax on income is meaningless.

As always, they accused him of glossing over the facts of the ""black hole"" at the centre of his finances which, they claim, would ensure tax increases after the election.Specifically, it saw him attempting to slaughter the council tax as an election issue and to tear limb from limb their wider policies for pensioners and families.In particular there will be an argument over precisely whose policies on the council tax will offer people the best deal.Like a surgeon, he attempted to target his handouts with absolute precision onto exactly the groups the government needs to appeal to in the election campaign.

Prudence made an appearance, albeit towards the end of his address, as he assured voters he would do nothing to mess up the economic stability he had brought to Britain and which, he claimed, would be thrown away by anyone else."
1258,"On pensions, Mr Kennedy said it was a ""scandal"" that the system discriminated against women who had missed making National Insurance payments when they were having children.Speaking in the Commons after Mr Brown had delivered what is widely thought to be the last Budget before the general election, Mr Kennedy acknowledged that the UK was one of the most successful economies in the world.

The chancellor went on to put up National Insurance contributions after the election.""And they wonder why people get cynical about their politicians when they give one impression before an election and do exactly the opposite after that election.Kennedy criticises 'unfair' taxes

Gordon Brown has failed to tackle the ""fundamental unfairness"" in the tax system in his ninth Budget, Charles Kennedy has said.

""For most individuals, most families, most households, it adds up to exactly the same thing,"" said Mr Kennedy.The government could not go on ""patching up"" the system, he added."
1259,"Everyone could see the chancellor's ""sweeteners"", but these hid tax rises for hard working families, he said.""We can all see the sweeteners, but they hide the crippling tax rises for hard-working families that are inevitable if Labour wins.He urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging ""millions of people in to the net"" to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax.""Their only answer is to tax, to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later.""""The chancellor's forecasts of surpluses are no better than the prime minister's forecasts of weapons of mass destruction.""

Mr Brown also said he had agreed with the Italian finance minister Domenico Siniscalco to push forward with plans for the world-wide sharing and co-ordination of research into the disease.

The problems of HIV/Aids were inseparable from poverty, he added.""I believe that the generation that provided the finance to combat, cure and eradicate the world's deadliest disease of today - and today the world's least curable disease - HIV/Aids - will rightly earn the title 'the great generation',"" Mr Brown said in a speech during his African tour.He hopes to use the UK's G8 presidency to push the issue forward.

There are also concerns about the number of workers from eastern European countries who will head west, exacerbating the already high unemployment levels in Germany.

""What we are now talking about is developing that market into an internal market in services.""The plans could introduce a free market into everything from computer services to construction.Shadow Europe minister Mr Brady said: ""I believe it is essential that Britain keeps the rebate and I think it's a crucial test of how firmly the British government is prepared to stand up for Britain internationally in Europe.

The chancellor said that the EU's planned changes in the growth and stability pact - designed to ensure that countries in the euro zone do not borrow too much - would force Britain to run a budget surplus of 1% over the economic cycle.

But, speaking to the Treasury Select Committee, Gordon Brown said that the new stability pact rules were not part of a binding Treaty and could be changed again the future - potentially opening the way for future euro membership.Earlier, ex-Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke welcomed a relaxation of the rules governing the euro zone.But the chancellor said Mr Fallon was ""impugning the integrity"" of the Office of National Statistics and said the decision had been made completely independently."

And knowing that she got the better of Diane in a head-to-head race will give Sarah confidence.Running sub-eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in Madrid she will be close to picking up a medal.In fact, the men's 60m hurdles is so strong, I think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to Madrid.

I thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways."

Although now in common use in almost all computers, these methods were pioneering when first used in the Macintosh.But the acceptance of the interface did not truly begin until the concept was developed for use by Apple in its pioneering Lisa computer.The GUI was developed by Xerox PARC, and used in its Star machine.The result was the 1984 Macintosh that did away with the then common text-based interface in favour of one based around graphics that resembled a virtual desktop and used folders and documents."

Mr Noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide back-up services on the network itself, instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves.

Orange told the BBC News website that those with Orange Smartphones could use the My Phone syncing service which means back-ups of address books and other data are created online.Generally, information from Sim cards can be backed up on physical memory cards, or can be copied onto computers via cables if the phone is a smartphone model with the right software."

The bar has been raised, and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future.

Developer Valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy.A casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be.

1979,"In late December movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the BitTorrent network.One of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the BitTorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or TV programmes they claimed to.

The legal campaign worked because of the way that BitTorrent is organised.Shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the BitTorrent network.He added that the legal attacks on BitTorrent had driven people away from sites such as Suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic.Legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down.

This, said Sloncek, should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music."

""It's not hard to see a point in the near future when every publisher wants you to run an application on your system purely to allow you to play their games,"" he said.Game maker Valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally.Authentication involved setting up an account with Valve's gaming community system called Steam and letting that check which copy of the game was being run.

One effect of Steam's popularity has been to limit the copies of the game sold in shops and artificially depress the game's ranking in the top ten."
2019,"Mozilla said that more than five million have downloaded the free software since its official release.There was a flurry of downloads on its first day of release.

Supporters of the open-source software in the US managed to raise $250,000 (Â£133,000) to advertise the release of Firefox 1.0 in The New York Times, and support the Mozilla Foundation.Opera is set to release its version 7.60 by the end of the year.Although there have been other preview versions of Firefox, version 1.0 was the first complete official program.Firefox is attractive to many because it is open-source.Net traffic monitor, OneStat.com, has reported that the open-source browser Firefox 1.0, released on 9 November, seems to be drawing users away from IE."

The only thing the phone can do is make and take calls.Once installed the program replaces all the icons on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working applications, such as contacts, calendar, notebook etc with non-working versions so the phone becomes almost useless.When installed the malicious program also locks many of the 7610's functions making it hard to use and harder to repair.Despite this Finnish anti-virus lab F-Secure said it had sporadic reports of 7610 owners being caught out by it."
2021,"That has a relatively large screen, even if it does only have slower GPRS access to the network.There is certainly room in the technology ecosystem for many different sorts of devices, accessing a wide range of services over different networks.If I want fast access to my e-mail I can get a 3G card for my laptop or hook up to a wireless network.The 3G services aren't quite there yet, and there is a lot to be sorted out when it comes to web access and data charges.Vodafone will let you access its services on Vodafone Live!This will please the network operators, who are looking for some revenue from their expensively acquired 3G licences.By contrast the confusing menus, complicated keyboard and truly irritating user interface of Max's 3G phone simply get in the way, and I did not see much value in the paid-for services, especially the limited web access."

The body will evaluate proposals from leading research, public and not-for-profit organizations, and is expected to oversee up to six projects a year.The first WCG problem being tackled will be the Human Proteome Folding Project, which hopes to identify the ways that the proteins in our body fold.

The idea follows the success of other similar projects that have used the untapped processing power of millions of desktop PCs.The computer company, working with United Devices, previously developed the Smallpox Research Grid, which linked together more than two million volunteers from 226 countries to speed the analysis of some 35 million drug molecules in the search for a treatment for Smallpox.

2026,"Valve has yet to release figures which show how many copies of the game were sold in this way.
The game sold more than 1 million copies in the first nine days that it was on sale.Although only released in November the sprawling story of guns, gangsters game beat off strong competition and by year end had sold more than 1.75 million copies.There were also records set for the number of games that achieved double-platinum status by selling more than 600,000 copies.This was because it was only released on PC and, compared to console titles, sold in relatively small numbers.Also the novel distribution system adopted by developer Valve meant that many players downloaded the title rather than travel to the shops to buy a copy.Elspa noted that sales of Xbox games rose 37.9% during the year."

The game's developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways.It is on a par with the jaw-dropping opening sequence of Onimusha 3 earlier this year, and when the game begins, it is something of an anti-climax.Perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be.Those flashy moves are back in full evidence, and tremendous fun to perform and perfect."

Deaf people who prefer to communicate using British Sign Language (BSL) could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter.

The service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a BSL interpreter via a webcam or video phone, and the interpreter then relays the deaf person's conversation using a telephone and translates the other person's response into sign language.

""There are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people,"" said RNID technology director, Guido Gybels.""I communicate in BSL; my written English is not very good and it takes me longer to think in English and type my message.""The Video Relay Service is being piloted by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people's pockets.Until now, the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator."
