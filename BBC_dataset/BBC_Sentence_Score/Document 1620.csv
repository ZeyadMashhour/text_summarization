"Henson stakes early Lions claim

The Six Nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four Home Unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to New Zealand with the Lions this summer.

The player who staked the biggest claim for a place in the starting XV over the weekend was Gavin Henson.,9.200000000000001,0.031001426236322575,49,-0.05938140161950301,0.02669422411935686,0.7475065231684979
He's very confident.,1.84,0.02067235186629975,9,0.06363013598345878,0.01942324527715176,0.5327216383189078
You just had to listen to his interview afterwards - he beamed with confidence - but although there's an element of arrogance it's good arrogance.,24.84,0.021497699963385773,58,0.045077176111001836,0.022088764240736518,0.7380536883491579
He certainly showed some nice touches.,1.84,0.021363883603458207,13,0.15312668608839336,0.024371394034191855,0.6216168666446593
"He once showed a clean pair of heels to Mathew Tait when he got outside him, his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand.",15.64,0.03774449768337895,55,0.23463260907384553,0.027541215629693902,0.7540197141619137
And that's without even mentioning his majestic match-winning penalty.,1.84,0.018886002367022564,31,0.010598434125104503,0.025305421257018464,0.7106352346876283
But I think we need to wait and see what happens because he needs to be put to the test.,5.5200000000000005,0.01898558626526216,11,0.016044926417653208,0.024706407344352956,0.6214019058042579
He needs to come up against Brian O'Driscoll or a big French midfield.,3.68,0.02244203595142753,31,-0.07113375656222372,0.025331045202001207,0.7101353916919264
Wales fly-half Stephen Jones was another player who impressed me.,5.5200000000000005,0.03837568381686558,37,-0.1422813403459544,0.026909877127818928,0.7323577893542136

He showed he can control a game.,5.5200000000000005,0.03749345019781037,15,0.18025735862071812,0.025427018382229046,0.6166354543887046
"With Jonny Wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number 10 shirt could be up for grabs and Jones, or maybe even Henson, could make the Lions team at fly-half.

Jones stuck his hand up and he certainly looks a better bet than Charlie Hodgson after Saturday's game.,9.200000000000001,0.021273134365164422,43,0.07303880809127176,0.026562484106911092,0.738326149175635
Some of the Wales forwards surprised me because I thought they would be out-muscled in the tight five.,2.7600000000000002,0.025523338009056054,41,-0.04226643456669401,0.02602680089365733,0.7229426766903888
England prop Julian White is a capable player but when it comes down to selection Gethin Jenkins is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top.,14.72,0.018997099513797303,69,0.028461844834274736,0.026600827690471996,0.7543089603457503

I thought Joe Worsley had a solid game and Jason Robinson and Josh Lewsey both did nothing wrong.,6.44,0.018378632853942884,52,0.06720790430598676,0.024357426043428755,0.7500303525701735
But it looked too soon for young Mathew Tait and I think it will be a while before we see him again.,2.7600000000000002,0.01921420771102605,19,0.10685981188350123,0.02116597531378774,0.692388402733389

Hogg made a couple of good runs while White had a pretty robust game - his defence is right up there.,21.16,0.03666664393040941,49,0.22185973455772667,0.027222863534122774,0.746223875562006
Cusiter looked very lively and he could be a very good option for Lions coach Sir Clive Woodward.,10.120000000000001,0.022167073827670896,52,0.08172601552867802,0.025059738055605116,0.7489776192117106

One player who didn't impress me was Wales scrum-half Dwayne Peel.,7.36,0.02802195837832121,37,-0.14316749642698268,0.024245504647114984,0.7322546620470333
