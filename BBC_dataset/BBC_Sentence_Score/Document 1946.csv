The blocking began early on Monday so those outside the US and trying to view the site got a message saying they are not authorised to view it.,36.800000000000004,0.02871836044565788,52,-0.15569918482508568,0.02987874408668521,0.7443400665984159
But keen net users have shown that the policy is not being very effective.,9.200000000000001,0.03240020151918429,30,-0.043526092811278234,0.028625602587865524,0.7049792204460769
"Many have found that the site can still be viewed by overseas browsers via several alternative net addresses.

The policy of trying to stop overseas visitors viewing the site is thought to have been adopted in response to an attack on the georgewbush.com website.,35.88,0.04967882590924025,79,-0.11352378062239021,0.030460980798236423,0.7573161353570983

The barring of non-US visitors has led to the campaign being inundated with calls and forced it to make a statement about why the blocking was taking place.,11.96,0.026208886669105,72,0.06873152770266955,0.030069764726936378,0.7484006223936499
"In early October a so-called ""denial of service"" attack was mounted on the site that bombarded it with data from thousands of PCs.",30.360000000000003,0.030700186687433233,69,-0.09208705949386017,0.029895192956761393,0.753198867274329

About the same time the web team of the Bush-Cheney campaign started using the services of a company called Akamai that helps websites deal with the ebbs and flows of visitor traffic.,22.080000000000002,0.04026139866210526,95,0.165793052519116,0.030621377920220967,0.7666984087624656
Akamai uses a web-based tool called EdgeScape that lets its customers work out where visitors are based.,6.44,0.03214788946207372,54,0.1446287278137338,0.02933050250121232,0.738823494158008

Geographic blocking works because the numerical addresses that the net uses to organise itself are handed out on a regional basis.,11.96,0.018594956635904544,66,-0.03826873337005006,0.028362700217497976,0.7488968235271162
Readers of the Boingboing weblog have found that viewers can still get at the site by using alternative forms of the George W Bush domain name.,23.92,0.02051520710004858,65,0.08614515573736657,0.028679184244789064,0.7497618519925375

There are now at least three working alternative domains for the Bush-Cheney campaign that let web users outside the US visit the site.,31.28,0.04884707199484941,56,0.209530023951728,0.030199939280603695,0.7469619512368066

Data gathered by Netcraft on the pattern of traffic to the site shows that the blocking is not the result of another denial of service attack.,39.56,0.055026529355940566,71,-0.10745418544083886,0.029905224185855922,0.7531295942826706
