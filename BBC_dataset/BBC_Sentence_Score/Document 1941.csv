The .post and .travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the net's administrative body.,11.040000000000001,0.06345310132554283,59,-0.11963033715415156,0.04769372035526037,0.743655790287163
"The names are just two of a total of 10 proposed domains that are being considered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, Icann.",2.7600000000000002,0.06409810859477914,72,-0.1331555736719466,0.05035530344740776,0.7492963231607022

"The .post domain is backed by the Universal Postal Union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help co-ordinate the e-commerce efforts of national post offices.

"The .travel domain would be used by hotels, travel firms, airlines, tourism offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online.",22.080000000000002,0.054456701434732496,76,-0.09209380293169783,0.04670791028967698,0.7526238667960006
It is backed by a New York-based trade group called The Travel Partnership.,1.84,0.048364398677360226,44,-0.06058781715941017,0.04590312623336274,0.7229407930085863
Icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted.,7.36,0.040046904317869725,92,-0.07678256240161313,0.04989774826228898,0.7541060802612127
"Despite this initial approval, Icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service.",7.36,0.04977771906426727,51,0.028508338535944797,0.047614389302257185,0.7278059065903095
At the same time Icann is considering proposals for another eight domains.,1.84,0.08332545671766718,23,0.24218030511416253,0.04734070452993749,0.6632506924338321
One that may not win approval is a proposal to set up a .xxx domain for pornographic websites.,23.0,0.047695351933175624,50,0.10641059335046678,0.04807664706295206,0.7386049136622836
A similar proposal has been made many times in the past.,4.6000000000000005,0.03907933551338493,27,0.29170912546091,0.04732329017329028,0.572624357662723
But Icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it.,4.6000000000000005,0.04242493923653665,51,0.13948098545421256,0.042052875494178785,0.7304067690652718
In 2000 Icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success.,1.84,0.042634746391429994,39,0.05195615174544049,0.04644489996730484,0.7294388607469102
Three of the new so-called top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as .museum and .aero.,2.7600000000000002,0.04068647082157933,59,-0.062128645634588996,0.04945023587104718,0.7310540852258083
Others such as .info and .biz were intended to be more generic.,0.92,0.048888888888888885,20,-0.01246280684291251,0.03548359761692724,0.6926508251817802
In total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations.,19.32,0.03509774779231845,38,-0.12384569238086954,0.045398949817994666,0.7203190128926824
