The best performance on the track for me was Sarah Claxton's win in the 60m hurdles.,7.36,0.043404291063440285,40,0.06756582762414433,0.02475424125692713,0.7295766652276123
Running sub-eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in Madrid she will be close to picking up a medal.,6.44,0.016881911450632562,51,0.11656038282828822,0.026032206873424855,0.7455620895887878
But what was great about Sunday's performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted.,9.200000000000001,0.022254944893250066,46,-0.05171781011174372,0.025559771435328126,0.7324095155958559

and I think she was surprised to be beaten by Sarah.,3.68,0.014834421275648286,18,0.04980436110715709,0.02097656294367533,0.665915076754652
And knowing that she got the better of Diane in a head-to-head race will give Sarah confidence.,5.5200000000000005,0.03276322634688065,44,0.15943240329599806,0.025853391088719865,0.7304725511781999

"In fact, the men's 60m hurdles is so strong, I think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to Madrid.

"Phillips Idowu lit up the field events, not only with his hair, but also with his leap of 17.30m, which puts him at the top of the world rankings.",4.6000000000000005,0.018601317471528187,59,0.019479246726397288,0.025721808001175288,0.7551421404860842
I had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there.,6.44,0.028465506196628253,22,-0.030066470139953914,0.02260167244261298,0.6613727398365166
He feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him - but then Phillips always has.,12.88,0.02778154502879214,34,-0.0852651983059198,0.025338054988787197,0.7289662654231673

He is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency - and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further.,11.040000000000001,0.027572250552072707,28,-0.0720752249734737,0.02346171319215175,0.7097834428419596
Across the board I thought Kelly Sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing.,7.36,0.01767498867510637,55,0.04084657740346125,0.025780885973585733,0.739806585383856

She has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well.,4.6000000000000005,0.024444444444444442,45,0.002293197062542398,0.02213360069954912,0.7232631705712732

I thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways.,1.84,0.042248635033371,28,0.08947205961356147,0.025927243743300323,0.7083545655150391

But the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldn't be the case.,11.96,0.019164426140490267,45,0.016735726617636098,0.025381976084335605,0.7392654474739733
