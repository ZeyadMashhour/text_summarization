The government's wireless watchdog is seeking help on the best way to regulate the technology behind such networks called Ultra Wideband (UWB).,11.040000000000001,0.039604527861122396,75,-0.05878080025959215,0.03358917647055871,0.7495376822127323
Ofcom wants to ensure that the arrival of UWB-using devices does not cause problems for those that already use the same part of the radio spectrum.,8.280000000000001,0.038490218885631186,57,0.20889913911894298,0.03697516893925184,0.7454033968416334

One of the more likely uses of UWB is to make it possible to send DVD quality video images wirelessly to TV screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home.,10.120000000000001,0.027539974566993156,80,0.008339839031527357,0.034078988229683166,0.7678626878623452

UWB could also be used to create so-called Personal Area Networks that let a person's gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves.,4.6000000000000005,0.032514083851440355,69,-0.07581399243120826,0.03666235605415706,0.7529054588123856

Early sight of the CEPT work has caused controversy as some think it over-emphasises UWB's potential to interfere with existing users.,6.44,0.024311350642188662,79,-0.08557719760294215,0.0355233393630828,0.7581736936812858
By contrast a preliminary Ofcom report found that it would be quite straight-forward to deploy UWB without causing problems for those that already use it.,4.6000000000000005,0.02827796697555279,73,0.18413193138075729,0.03546856382972166,0.7508924126290677
