Profits have been under pressure in the airline industry, with low-cost firms driving down prices and demand dipping after the 11 September terrorist attacks and the outbreak of the killer SARS virus.

""Of course we applaud humanitarian initiatives, but why target the airlines?"" said Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus, secretary general of the Association of European Airlines.There is thought to be widespread support for the plan - tabled by France and Germany following the recent G7 meeting of the world's richest nations - from EU ministers.The issue of poverty in Africa and South Asia has forced itself to the top of the politicial agenda, with politicians and campaigners calling for more to be done.It added that any plan to levy taxes on jet fuel ""should not hinder the competitiveness of the airlines and that they themselves will not be solely funding development"".""Our industry is in the midst of a fundamental crisis...only to be once again confronted with a measure designed to increase our costs,"" he continued.

One of the world's largest manufacturers of HIV/Aids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills - supplied to poorer African countries - back into Europe for resale at far higher price.

The result is that drugs supplied to Africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in Europe; bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of HIV-positive Africans through their government's health care systems.

GlaxoSmithKline believes that by coating the pills destined for Africa in a red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging, then this trade can be substantially reduced.The company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in Africa who have re-sold humanitarian drugs for profit, as well as those suppliers in Europe that have also been involved in the trade.The company, GlaxoSmithKline, is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills, currently provided to developing nations under a humanitarian agreement.But the wide difference in price also means that there are big gains to be made from illegally diverting these cheaper drugs back into wealthier countries and re-selling them at a higher price.They want to maintain their profits, but have been put under tremendous pressure to provide cheap anti-Aids drugs to the world's poorest nations.

The falls were triggered when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that US crude stocks were 3.5% higher than a year ago.However, traders warned that the fall could be short-lived if there is a cold snap in North America this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world.

Yukos claims that it is being punished for the political ambitions of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is now in jail facing separate fraud charges.One scenario is that Baikal will not pay when it is supposed to in two weeks time, putting Yuganskneftegas back in the hands of bailiffs and back within the reach of Gazprom.Gazprom had been expected to win the auction but is thought to have failed to get finance for the deal after a US court injunction barred it from taking part.It has been hit with more than $27bn in taxes and fines and many observers now say that the break up of the firm that accounts for 20% of Russia's oil output is inevitable.

LG card's creditors fear that such a move would triggered massive debt redemption requests that could bankrupt the firm, which owes about $12.05bn.LG Group has said providing further help to the credit card issuer could hurt its corporate credibility and could spark shareholder lawsuits.The firm returned to profit in September 2004, but now needs a capital injection to avoid being delisted from the Korea Stock Exchange.LG Card almost collapsed in 2003 due to an increase in overdue credit card bills after the bursting of a credit bubble."

The government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US.In a statement, detainee 'A' in Woodhill Prison said: ""I hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal 'law' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones.""""The law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.Solicitor Gareth Pierce, who represents eight of the detainees, claimed the detention had driven four of the detainees to ""madness"", saying two were being held in Broadmoor hospital.
But Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile, the government's independent reviewer of anti-terrorism laws, said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released."

As a general rule, the more extreme the circumstances and fear felt, the more force can be used lawfully in self-defence, it said, adding that householders do not have to wait to be attacked before defending themselves.In one of Britain's highest profile cases, Norfolk farmer Tony Martin was jailed for life for murdering 16-year-old burglar Fred Barras, in 1999.The leaflet, published by police and prosecutors, aims to combat confusion about current legislation, which lets people use ""reasonable force"".In cases involving householders attacking intruders prosecutors and police were ""determined"" they would be dealt with ""as swiftly and as sympathetically as possible"", it said.
But knocking someone unconscious then killing them or hurting them further, or setting a trap for an intruder without involving the police were given as examples of ""excessive and gratuitous"" force."
1126,"In revised proposals from the Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC), the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be ""weighed carefully"" by a judge so they did not lead to ""an inappropriately short sentence"".Director of Public Prosecutions, Ken Macdonald QC, who sits on the SGC, said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament.In a statement issued on Wednesday Lord Woolf said: ""I have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the SGC has vastly improved the final guidelines.But director of the Victims of Crime Trust, Norman Brennan, accused Lord Woolf of having an ""arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law-abiding public"".""It represents a tougher regime than existed previously, because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity,"" he said.
The guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible, by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co-operation, he said.

At the time Lord Woolf, the Lord Chief Justice, had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances - for example, if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected."

The Police Federation has said it strongly opposes giving Community Support Officers (CSOs) the power to detain suspects for up to 30 minutes.

The Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill proposes extra powers to search suspects, enforce licensing offences, direct traffic and deter begging.
Ms Berry said this ""dramatically changes"" their original purpose - to be a visible presence combating low-level crime and anti-social behaviour.There are about 3,500 CSOs in England and Wales but the government intends to have 25,000 on the streets by 2008 at a cost of Â£50m. They already have powers to hand out fines for a wide range of offences.Shadow home secretary David Davis said the research appeared to acknowledge that CSOs were having no discernible effect on crime figures.

The federation said CSOs do not have the experience, training and safety equipment to deal with ""potentially confrontational"" situations.But the report also showed that the public is having difficulties distinguishing between a civilian officer and a proper officer.

Firstly, the prime minister insisted on Wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get G8 countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami-hit countries.It dominated the prime minister's monthly news conference, which saw Mr Blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour.All this came amid fresh claims that Mr Brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had, as a result, started to set out his own platform.This time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government's global aid and debt initiatives, particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster - an issue many hoped and believed was above such things."

Stephen Pound echoed the message, saying: ""We know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve, not for the Labour Party but for this country, is the appearance of division.The dressing down appears to have done the trick, with Mr Brown joining his alleged rival Alan Milburn - who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in Mr Brown's stead - and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at an election poster launch.The views expressed by both backbenchers and Labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely-held view within the Labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election.Even as the MPs were expressing their fears it emerged that, while Mr Brown is in Africa for a week, the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term.Similarly, some were pointing out that the chancellor, during the election poster launch, once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said.None the less, what some believe now is that the effect of the warnings from the backbenchers will actually be to silence the Brown camp, effectively strengthening the prime minister's hand.Firstly, nobody is attempting to suggest any more that the stories of the rift between the chancellor and the prime minister are fictions created by the media and authors."

The first inkling something slightly odd was afoot was when - in place of the soft rock music normally chosen for such occasions - Labour's speakers crackled to life with the sound of Booker T and the MGs.As the side-door slid open, it looked for one glorious moment as if the Cabinet had decided to bury their differences and go on the road together, Scooby Doo-style.Mr Brown repeated the familiar mantras displayed on the posters and spoke of Labour's ""shared purpose"" and ""united dedication"".The chancellor walked side-by-side with Mr Milburn, pointedly exchanging chit chat, as they approached the microphone.If press reports are to be believed, Alan Milburn and Gordon Brown have been at each other's throats over the contents of Labour's next election manifesto."

Tony Blair's feud with Gordon Brown is damaging the way the UK is governed, Tory leader Michael Howard has claimed in a heated prime minister's questions.

The prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Monday's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made Mr Peston's book.
Later at their poster launch Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said his party would exploit opportunities to show how ""juvenile"" the prime minister and chancellor were.

Mr Blair said he would not respond to ""tittle tattle in books"" and promised to hail Labour's record on the economy, waiting lists and law and order ""from now until polling day"".""He can stick up whatever he likes on billboards about something in a book but what the public will concentrate on are the low mortgages, low inflation, low unemployment that we delivered and that he failed to,"" he said.But Mr Blair dismissed the talk of splits and said people's priorities at the next elections would be on the economic successes achieved by Labour."
1158,"Nothing as obscure as ""post-neo-classical endogenous growth theory"" which the chancellor himself once quoted - but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with.

How political squabbles snowball

It's become commonplace to argue that Blair and Brown are like squabbling school kids and that they (and their supporters) need to grow up and stop bickering.

It is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively, but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly.

In the case of the Labour Party, if you believe the rift between Blair and Brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest, Solomon's wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem.But as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other, an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms, results in arms levels that are too high.Each participant genuinely wants the row to stop, but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard.It's often referred to as the ""prisoner's dilemma"", based on a parable much told in economics degree courses... about a sheriff and two prisoners."
1159,"An unremittingly ""New"" Labour manifesto, as the prime minister is happy to make plain, will stress the importance of that - the belief patients and parents, for example, want a choice of good services before they start worrying about who has provided them.To that end he set out a broad programme aimed to appeal to both middle England voters who switched to the party in 1997 and stuck with it, possibly through some gritted teeth, in 2001, and to more traditional lower income old Labour supporters.Under what is to be the general election slogan ""Britain is working"", the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly New Labour.There was little in terms of concrete proposals or what might form manifesto pledges, although the prime minister talked about a ""New Labour manifesto that will be aimed at all sections of society"".And there was an insistence on the importance of the party continuing to operate as unremittingly ""New"" Labour - although that may continue to irritate his chancellor.

Blair looks to election campaign

Tony Blair's big speech will be looked back on as the performance that kicked off the election campaign.

His was more a speech designed to remind people, and some in his own party, precisely what New Labour stood for, and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach."
1160,"Tories unveil quango blitz plans

Plans to abolish 162 quangos have been unveiled by the Conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut.

""Cuts on this scale cannot be found from cutting 'bureaucracy' but would require massive cuts to front-line public services such as schools, hospitals and the police.""The plans would abolish regional assemblies and other regional bodies, such as boards tackling industrial development and housing.""Far from improving public services, spending taxpayers' money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats, more regulation and higher taxes.""The Liberal Democrats have said they would cut the number of Whitehall departments to make sure money reaches frontline services.

The Tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people, rather than officials, run hospitals and surgeries.

Peers are debating proposals to change the rules governing the succession to the throne.

""The basic point is that the EU seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from Britain - and we oppose that and the Tories cannot be trusted to oppose it"".

The aim of UKIP is to withdraw from the EU and if it has any relation to the Tories it is to stiffen the Tories' spine on the issue by having a large enough UKIP vote so that we move the Tories in the direction they are refusing to move.

1163,"More reforms ahead says Milburn

Labour will continue to pursue controversial reforms if it wins a third term in power, the party's election chief Alan Milburn has said.

Oliver Letwin said the government had failed to deliver in any of the key public services, such as cleaner hospitals, discipline in schools and putting more police on the streets.Mr Milburn gave more details of planned reforms in a speech to Labour's Fabian Society, in which he also praised Mr Brown as one of the leaders of the party's reform process.""No-one is talking about driving people into work but what we do know is there are one million people on incapacity benefit who want the opportunity to work, providing the right level of support is there for them"".Tory Shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin called Labour ""a brilliant machine for talking about things"" but said it did not deliver policies the country needs.For the Lib Dems, Simon Hughes said many pensioners are means tested for the money they needed and students who were told there wouldn't be tuition fees and more debt ""have been given exactly the opposite"".Mr Milburn also sought to draw a line under the controversy about reports of a feud between Gordon Brown and Prime Minister Tony Blair.

1165,"Defection timed to hit tax pledge

With impeccable and precisely-calculated timing, Tory defector Robert Jackson and his new Labour bosses have attempted to overshadow Michael Howard's latest announcement on taxation and spending.

It is the Tories' attempt to open that famed ""clear blue water"" between them and the Labour party and return to a traditional Tory agenda that will both reassure the middle England voters who have abandoned him and appeal to core Conservative voters.With just about everyone in Westminster now working towards a May general election, Mr Howard is eager to map out some clear and distinctive policies aimed at finally shifting the Tories' resolutely depressing poll showings.So it is a pretty safe bet to assume that, when Robert Jackson finally decided to jump ship and swim over to the Labour benches, his new masters decided to time the announcement for the greatest possible impact.But Mr Howard announced that, of the Â£35bn he has earmarked from savings, Â£12bn will be used to plug Labour's claimed financial black hole with any left over going to tax cuts in Mr Letwin's first budget.The big idea is his Â£35bn savings on waste and bureaucracy which Mr Howard has pledged to plough back into public services and tax cuts.He would not be precise, but there are already suggestions he is set to announce lifting the threshold on income tax and reforming or abolishing inheritance tax."
1166,"However, Chief Treasury Secretary Paul Boateng said: ""None of the Tories' figures add up so they can't make these savings and can't pay for any tax cuts, which means the only guaranteed cut from the Tories is Â£35bn of cuts, hitting frontline public services hard.""Mr Howard said: ""All this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair, who will waste more and tax more, and a Conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less.""Tory leader unveils spending plan

Tory leader Michael Howard says his party can save Â£35bn in government spending by tackling waste.

And the Liberal Democrats will take three key seats from the Conservatives, leaving the Tories with just 163 MPs, two less than they returned atLabour's 1997 landslide and their worst showing since 1906.
Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy added: ""People will not be taken in by Michael Howard's claims of Â£35bn worth of savings.The money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the NHS and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes.The bulk of the Â£35bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services, Mr Howard said."
1167,"He was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than Â£100,000 a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees, the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax.Kennedy looks to election gains

They may not know quite how to describe their position in British politics - the real opposition, the valid opposition, the effective opposition or the authentic opposition.

But Mr Kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible, costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax, crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name.
As Tory leader Michael Howard kicked off his election campaign, the Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy dismissed the Conservatives as a ""fading"" force.On the war on Iraq, identity cards, student fees and the council tax, there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the Liberal Democrats offered costed, sensible alternatives.The gap between Labour and the Tories was now so narrow - as proved, he claimed, by the defection to Labour of Robert Jackson - that only his party offered a genuine alternative.And he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things."

Shadow attorney general Dominic Grieve criticised the government on its plans to change what he said was an ""exceptional institution,"" providing a ""champion of the independence of the judiciary"".Former Cabinet minister Douglas Hogg, whose father and grandfather served as lord chancellor, said the Bill was ""largely unnecessary, bureaucratic and expensive"".He warned that unless ministers backed down over the lord chancellor remaining a member of the House of Lords, the government would have ""great difficulty"" in getting the Bill through Parliament.Under the reforms, the Law Lords will also be replaced as the UK's highest legal authority by a Supreme Court and judges will be appointed by an independent panel rather than ministers.

'Best person' for top legal job

The ""best person for the job"" should be appointed lord chancellor, and not necessarily a lawyer or MP, the courts minister has told MPs.

In December the Lords rejected a plea by current Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer that the holder of the job should not necessarily be a lawyer or a peer.The debate was carried over from the last Parliamentary session, but with an impending general election time is crucial for the government to get the Bill passed."

The memory driving Brown's mission

The memory Gordon Brown says keeps returning to him - the one that he says is burnt into him - is that of a 12 year-old girl, whose parents died of Aids, and who is HIV positive herself.

It also goes some way to solving one of the overarching problems for all politicians of all parties: scepticism sliding into cynicism about politics itself.If Mr Blair won't allow him to run the election campaign then he can at least pretend it was all getting tedious and he'd much rather be out examining social problems in the raw.Mr Brown's message generally, that compassion must become action before that hope is squandered."

Tony Blair has launched an attack on Conservative spending plans, saying they are a ""ludicrous improbability"".

Meanwhile, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr Blair of ""misrepresenting"" the party's proposals and questioned how Labour would fund its own plans.On Saturday, Tory shadow home secretary David Davis said the Tories would fund the cuts by removing ""inefficiencies"" which had ""burgeoned"" under Labour.According to an advance text released by officials, he told delegates: ""We must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them."

Charles Kennedy has told voters his Liberal Democrats will offer them an ""honest choice"" at the next general election.

With his party's previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government, he has switched tack.But, unlike the old Tory-Labour debate, he believes voters are ready to see ""modest"" tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services.That suggests the Lib Dem leader believes he may well find himself in a powerful, even pivotal position in a vastly different House of Commons after the next election."
1179,"""We are being straightforward with people, saying you know there is likely to be an increase in the tax burden, we are only recommending one specific tax rise for the top end of income scale earners to fund three specific policies"".

If, as expected, his party increases its showing at the election, he intends to go into the next parliament ""on the front foot with a view to leading it right through that parliament into the next election because I see that as the decisive opportunity for us"".That last remark reflects a view gaining ground in Westminster that, if the Tories do as badly as some fear, the election after next might really see that historic breakthrough by the third party.Under a Labour government the tax burden would have to rise, while the Tories' plans to increase spending in some areas while also reducing taxes is just incredible, he claims.

Kennedy's cautious optimism

Charles Kennedy is far too canny to make any grand claims about how his party may fare at the general election.

He insists his three headline commitments, to be financed from a 1% tax increase on those earning over Â£100,000 a year, will appeal right across the political spectrum.""Therefore the potential is there for the Liberal Democrat advance to be one of the big stories of the election, given that we have the capacity to take on Labour and win as well as take on the Conservatives and win."

Surely we the public would be better protected if the security services, rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest (and for how long?)They were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attack.

We, as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro US propaganda, which of course also means we'll inherit most, if not all of their total paranoia, and allow our governments, of any political persuasion incidentally, to gradually, and insidiously, impose a police state by well tried & tested back door methods.Notwithstanding these and the attempted and nearly successful assassination attempts on Prime Minister Thatcher in Brighton and on later occupants of 10 Downing Street, there was no retaliatory blitz on Belfast or Dublin as there has been on Afghanistan and Iraq.We have to see off these latest attempts on our liberties including ID cards, which Winston Churchill decided had to go since, he said, the average Bobby on the beat could not be relied on to not be tempted to take undue advantage against the citizen going about their lawful activities (incidentally I can still remember my old ID card number).I agree in many ways with what Mr Forsyth has said - if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk - how can we accuse countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent, it is hypocrisy of the highest order.The new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory ID cards and the linking of data bases, together with the un-British idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years."

But a short statement about Lord Goldsmith's position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action.According to Mr Sands, Lord Goldsmith had warned Tony Blair in a document on 7 March 2003 that the use of force against Iraq could be illegal and that it would have been safer to seek a second UN resolution sanctioning military action.

So, Mr Howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor.One of New Labour's greatest successes before the historic 1997 election was to persuade voters, business and the City that it could be trusted to run the economy.And that is where one of the problems lies for Mr Howard - can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services AND lower taxes?"

I hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that Mr Blair and Mr Brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won't take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping, or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door?

Support for a ban on hunting has fallen in the past six years, a poll suggests.

The number opposed to a ban remains constant, but those ""neither supporting nor opposing"" has increased by 11%.The Mail on Sunday survey found that 63% supported a hunting ban compared with 24% against.In the Countryfile survey, 47% said they supported the legislation, with 26% against."
1277,"At a glance: Tory health checks

The UK' opposition Conservatives have unveiled plans to introduce health checks for immigrants if they win the General Election.Labour claims the policy is little more than a ""desperate attempt to catch up with Labour's five-year plan"" for immigration and asylum, which was published last week.People would have to prove they have an acceptable standard of health and are unlikely to be a danger to public health in the UK, or impose significant costs or demands on the NHS.They claim government figures show that TB in England has increased by 25% over the last 10 years and that nearly two-thirds of people with the disease were born overseas.Home Office Minister Des Browne says the Government already routinely checks people for TB if they come into the UK for six months or more from high-risk countries.However, they will undergo health checks to ensure they receive the right medical treatment and do not spread infectious diseases.

People coming to Britain for less than six months would not be medically tested unless they intended to work in health care, childcare or teaching."

UK citizens suspected of involvement in terrorism could face house arrest as part of a series of new measures outlined by the home secretary.

Deals are already being sought to deport some of the foreign detainees who are mainly held in Belmarsh Prison in London under the current laws introduced after the US terror attacks on 11 September 2001.Charles Clarke's planned ""control orders"" mean anyone suspected of being involved in terrorism could be subject to house arrest, curfews or tagging.Mr Clarke said efforts would continue to deport them to their countries of origin Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan without them facing torture or death.

Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis was worried about extending special powers to cover British citizens.Mr Clarke said prosecutions were the government's first preference and promised the powers would only be used in ""serious"" cases, with independent scrutiny from judges.

UK Chancellor Gordon Brown has offered Â£960m ($1.8bn) over 15 years to an international scheme aiming to boost vaccination and immunisation schemes.

Campaign groups including Friends of the Earth, the World Development Movement, and War on Want said UK government policy on free trade was a major barrier to fighting poverty.Britain, France, Gavi and the Gates Foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the International Finance Facility (IFF) to the area of immunisation.Mr Brown welcomed news that the Bill Gates Foundation and Norway are joining up to put an extra Â£0.53bn ($1bn ) into the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi).The chancellor was speaking at an event jointly organised by the UK's Department for International Development and the UN Development Programme on Wednesday.That could see donors making long-term, legally binding financial commitments which can then be used as collateral for raising extra funds from international capital markets.In a speech, he called for action to reach the 2000 Millennium Declaration goals of halving global poverty and tackling child mortality rates."

UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has defended plans to end the European Union's arms embargo on China, despite opposition from the US and Japan.

Tory foreign affairs spokesman Michael Ancram said lifting the arms embargo would be ""irresponsible"" and would damage Britain's relations with the US.Mr Straw, visiting Beijing, noted arms embargoes applied to China, Burma and Zimbabwe but not to North Korea, which he said had a terrible rights record.But Mr Straw insisted the EU's code of conduct on arms exports meant tough criteria on human rights still had to be met if the embargo was lifted.

1283,"Plan to give elderly care control

Elderly and disabled people would choose how their own budget for personal care was spent and organised under government plans.

1284,"But he argued that the EU was moving in the direction of the UK principles, and would eventually recognise the need to consider budget deficits over a longer period than one year, to include investment, and to take more account of the total size of government debt as well as the balance each year.In March the Office of National Statistics (ONS) reclassified Â£3.4bn of spending on road repairs as public investment - shortly before the chancellor announced in the Budget that he would meet his own fiscal budget rule by only Â£6bn.But, speaking to the Treasury Select Committee, Gordon Brown said that the new stability pact rules were not part of a binding Treaty and could be changed again the future - potentially opening the way for future euro membership.He told the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee that the EU rules ""make it difficult for a low debt country to run the investment programmes that are necessary to improve its infrastructure"".The chancellor said that the EU's planned changes in the growth and stability pact - designed to ensure that countries in the euro zone do not borrow too much - would force Britain to run a budget surplus of 1% over the economic cycle.

Conservative Michael Fallon asked Mr Brown whether the Treasury had leaned on ONS to make this change, and said that the ONS had received a written paper from the Treasury on this matter.But the chancellor said Mr Fallon was ""impugning the integrity"" of the Office of National Statistics and said the decision had been made completely independently."

 - Legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes.

The aim of the new legislation was to provide a ""medium range"" of penalties, such as fines, community service orders, compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews.

Former international development secretary Clare Short questioned the effectiveness of debt relief as a means of tackling poverty.

That document is likely to feature in the exhibition the archives will put on next year as part of a series of events across London to mark the 400th anniversary of Guy Fawkes' conspiracy.Divorce by Parliament was an expensive process open really only to the rich but the records also include the testimony of maids, butlers and coachmen about their masters and mistresses.Tax bills may be an extra source for pedigree hunters - the longest stretches for about 300m and is longer than the Palace of Westminster itself, listing the names of appointed tax collectors."

The date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and, despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll, it has not shifted.A second central argument will be over taxation, with the Tories claiming the Chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if Labour wins again.And Chancellor Gordon Brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign - to the relief of many of his supporters in Westminster - to underline that economic message.The prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller, slower increase in spending planned by the Tories compared to Labour's plans was a cut.Mr Brown slaps that aside, claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate."

Profile: Gordon Brown

The ultimate prize of 10 Downing Street may continue to elude him but, as he prepares to deliver a record-breaking ninth budget, Gordon Brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times.

Events like this, and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues, make it impossible to dismiss the Brown/Blair feud as just journalistic hearsay, cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of Westminster.Mr Blair, for his part, is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful Mr Brown, who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his Budget until the last possible minute.He achieved a first class degree in history from Edinburgh University, where he went on to complete a PhD. His early career was spent lecturing, working in television and making a name for himself in the Scottish Labour Party.

And Mr Blair's decision to name his own retirement date has at least given Mr Brown something to aim for - even if the prime minister's intention to ""serve a full third term"" if elected, took the shine off the announcement for the chancellor and his supporters.
Yet they are portrayed by the media as being locked in almost permanent conflict, with Mr Brown supposedly nursing resentment at being betrayed by his younger Downing Street neighbour over the succession."

Meanwhile, nine-times champion Dermot Donnelly will not be coming out of retirement to compete in the Northern Ireland Cross Country Championships in Coleraine on Saturday.An injury crisis in the Annadale Striders squad led to Donnelly being entered by coach John McLaughlin but the athlete told BBC Sport on Friday evening that he would not be running.Willowfield's Paul Rowan will go in as individual favourite but Annadale could have a tough job holding on to their team title as Andrew Dunwoody and Noel Pollock are unlikely to run.
US-based Alistair Cragg and Mark Carroll are the only Irish athletes selected so far for the Europeans who will not run in Sheffield.In-form James McIlroy will hope to confirm his place in the British team for Madrid by winning the 800m title.Corkman Mark Carroll confirmed in midweek that he would join Cragg in the European Championships."

Jolanda Ceplak has urged Britain's Kelly Holmes to continue competing at the major championships.

Double Olympic gold medallist Holmes has strongly hinted she will not run in this year's Worlds and is undecided about next month's European Indoors.Meanwhile, Ceplak will be looking to follow up last Saturday's win in Boston with a fast time and victory in Friday's Night of Athletics in Erfurt, Germany.Britain's Jason Gardener had been expected to defend his 60m title in Erfurt but instead he will save himself for a competition in Leipzig on Sunday."

Athletics fans endured a year of mixed emotions in 2004 as stunning victories went hand-in-hand with disappointing defeats and more drugs scandals.

Yelena Isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record, but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in Birmingham.

Apparently, Isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and I would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time.Canadian Heather Hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if Jo Pavey had been in last year's shape she would have given Defar a real run for her money.From an international perspective, I thought Meseret Defar was disappointing in the 3,000m, but I don't think the pace-making was great.Yes, Samaria let Kelly get away, but there was no coming back over the last 200m as Kelly dominated the race, so beating Samaria is a bit of a benchmark for Kelly.I think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact Defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly.

United have also been hit by injuries to both Alan Smith and Louis Saha during Van Nistelrooy's absence, meaning Wayne Rooney has sometimes had to play in a lone role up front.Even without Van Nistelrooy, United made it 13 wins in 15 league games with a 2-0 derby victory at Manchester City on Sunday.He has been out of action for nearly three months and had targeted a return in the Champions League tie with AC Milan on 23 February.The 28-year-old has been training in Holland and Ferguson said: ""Ruud comes back on Tuesday and we need to assess how far on he is.But they will be boosted by the return of the Dutch international, who is the club's top scorer this season with 12 goals.But Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson hinted he may be back early."
1409,"Moyes U-turn on Beattie dismissal

Everton manager David Moyes will discipline striker James Beattie after all for his headbutt on Chelsea defender William Gallas.

Moyes continued: ""Although the incident was totally out of character - James has never even been suspended before in his career - his actions were unacceptable and had a detrimental effect on his team-mates.""

The club website also reported that Beattie, who seemed unrepentant after Saturday's match, insisting Gallas ""would have stayed down a lot longer"" if he had headbutted him, has now apologised.The Scot initially defended Beattie, whose dismissal put Everton on the back foot in a game they ultimately lost 1-0, saying Gallas overreacted.Moyes added: ""My comments on Saturday came immediately after the final whistle and at a point when I had only had the opportunity to see one, very quick re-run of the incident.""James did issue a formal apology to myself, his team-mates and to the Everton supporters immediately after the game and that was the right thing to have done.Speaking immediately after the game, Moyes said: ""I don't think it was a sending-off, I have been a centre-half in my time and I would have been ashamed to have gone down as easily as that.

Scotland manager Walter Smith has given his backing to the reinstatement of the Home International series.

Ahmed 'Mido' Hossam has made another apology to the Egyptian people in an attempt to rejoin the national team.

Mido joined Tottenham in an 18-month loan deal near the end of the January transfer window, scoring twice on his debut against Portsmouth.
The 21-year-old told a news conference in Cairo on Sunday that he is sorry for the problems that have led to his exclusion from the Pharaohs since July last year.""I feel that the national players are playing with a new spirit as I saw them play against Belgium (Egypt won 4-0 on Wednesday) and I simply want to add to their success.Meanwhile, Egypt FA spokesman Methat Shalaby welcomed the apology and said no one had exerted pressure on Mido to apologise.Mido was axed by former coach Marco Tardelli after failing to answer a national call-up, claiming he had a groin injury."

Manchester United reduced Chelsea's Premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over Manchester City.

But United could have a had a third late on when substitute Ryan Giggs hit the post.

- Manchester City boss Kevin Keegan: ""We had a great chance to take the lead and the first goal was always going to be crucial.Only Shaun Wright-Phillips appeared capable of interrupting the monotony, looking lively down the right and causing Gabriel Heinze problems.

Steven Gerrard has admitted that Liverpool have little chance of winning the Champions League this season.

John Arne Riise volleyed Liverpool ahead after 45 seconds but Steven Gerrard scored a 79th-minute own goal.The goal, the quickest-ever in a League Cup final, stunned a Blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to Newcastle and Barcelona in the previous week.Nevertheless, Liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from Dudek on 54 minutes, first at full stretch from Gudjohnsen's header, then to smother William Gallas' follow-up.But Gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected Ferrerira's free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring Chelsea level.Cech, Paulo Ferreira, Ricardo Carvalho, Terry, Gallas (Kezman 74), Jarosik (Gudjohnsen 45), Lampard, Makelele, Cole (Johnson 81), Drogba, Duff.

A late header by teenager Danny Graham earned Middlesbrough a battling draw with Charlton at the Riverside.

Charlton's early pressure paid off when Bartlett received a long ball from Talal El Karkouri in the box and laid it off to Holland who buried his right-footed strike.The Boro defender looked suspiciously offside as he got on the end of Gareth Southgate's misdirected effort, but despite the Charlton protests his goal stood.The striker played a great one-two with Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink only to see Kiely get down well to smother his shot before directing a header straight into the keeper's arms."

The England international, 24, was hurt in an innocuous challenge with Alan Shearer during the Londoners' FA Cup defeat at Newcastle on Sunday.Celestine Babayaro left the club in January, ironically to join Newcastle, and although Gallas has deputised at left-back before, he is struggling to be fit himself.""We think it's a big injury,"" said Jose Mourinho, whose Chelsea team this week meet Barcelona in the Champions League and Liverpool in the Carling Cup final.With Bridge having gone off after Mourinho used all three substitutes, those knocks plus Carlo Cudicini's red card meant Chelsea finished the game with seven able-bodied players.France defender Gallas and Ireland winger Duff both picked up their injuries in the closing stages of Chelsea's 1-0 defeat at St James' Park.

He is also searching for an investment package of a size and stature that will restore Liverpool to their place at European football's top table.Liverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights - but the realism of Arsenal's stunning Â£100m deal for their new Emirates Stadium at Ashburton has changed the landscape.He knows some traditionalist Liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just 'Anfield', but the maths of modern-day football decree that multi-millions for stadium and team could ease the pain.

Liverpool have not won the championship since 1990, a fact that causes deep discomfort inside Anfield as they attempt to muscle in on the top three of Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal.But it is a challenge that appears to sit easily with Parry, who has forged a reputation as one of football's most respected administrators since his days at the fledgling Premier League.

Liverpool forward Milan Baros is uncertain whether he remains part of boss Rafa Benitez's plans after being dropped for the Carling Cup final.

Baros denied suggestions he wanted to leave the Millennium Stadium before the match upon learning of his omission from the starting line-up.The Czech international came on as a substitute after 74 minutes but could not prevent his side losing 3-2 to Chelsea after extra-time.

Baros, who is Liverpool's leading scorer this season, denied reports of a row with Benitez but claims he is mystified at being left on the bench.But his admission that he ""guessed something like this was going to happen on Saturday"", will do little to quell claims of a falling-out with Benitez.He told Czech newspaper Daily Sport: ""I don't know why I didn't play on Sunday.And although Baros insisted thoughts of quitting Anfield are ""not in my mind right now"", he admitted ""everything is possible"".

During that stormy game in October, United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy caught Arsenal's Ashley Cole with one particularly strong tackle.Wenger later accused Van Nistelrooy of ""cheating"" and was fined Â£15,000 and ""severely reprimanded"" by the Football Association.""

France's regular back-row combination of Betsen, Harinordoquy and Olivier Magne were all missing from France's side at the weekend because of injury.Laporte said he was confident that Betsen would be cleared by the panel investigating his alleged trip that broke Wasps centre Stuart Abbott's leg.The trio have been called up after Pieter de Villiers, Ludovic Valbon and Aurelien Rougerie all picked up injuries in France's 16-9 win on Saturday.

1619,"Wales critical of clumsy Grewcock

Wales coach Mike Ruddock says England lock Danny Grewcock needs to review his actions after he kicked Dwayne Peel.

In the forthcoming games, Ruddock may use penalty hero Gavin Henson as his first-choice kicker in place of Stephen Jones.Trouble flared at a ruck in the first half of Wales' 11-9 win in Cardiff as Grewcock came recklessly over the top with his boot, leaving Peel bloodied.Ruddock also warned his RBS 6 Nations Championship rivals that his team can make massive improvements.""We created more opportunities and also squandered them by taking more contact and playing more individually,"" said the coach.""He's a great player and I don't want to knock him, we won't be calling for the match commissioner to review the incident.Grewcock was sin-binned with Wales captain Gareth Thomas for retaliation."
1620,"Henson stakes early Lions claim

The Six Nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four Home Unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to New Zealand with the Lions this summer.

With Jonny Wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number 10 shirt could be up for grabs and Jones, or maybe even Henson, could make the Lions team at fly-half.

Paul O'Connell just needs to add a hard edge to his game and Malcolm O'Kelly keeps on going and seems to be putting his hand up, while Shane Byrne seems to be a lively character.England prop Julian White is a capable player but when it comes down to selection Gethin Jenkins is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top.He ran some good lines against Italy, made the breaks and fed his outside backs, although Italy defended man on man which made it easy for him.You just had to listen to his interview afterwards - he beamed with confidence - but although there's an element of arrogance it's good arrogance.He once showed a clean pair of heels to Mathew Tait when he got outside him, his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand."
1621,"So really we went back to playing a territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball.It was great work by Brian and I always knew I had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee.It was very physical and fair play to the Italians they made us work very hard for our victory.

In the backs, we were not frustrated at such, but the new rucking laws were a little bit problematical.We were penalised a lot at the breakdown, and if they had kicked all their chances at goal we would have been behind at the break.The different interpretations between the referee and the players was a little difficult.It was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it."

His pass to Tom Shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and Michael Owen's long cut-out pass gave the lurking Thomas an easy run-in.

Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over.

Wales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try."
1625,"White prepared for battle

Tough-scrummaging prop Julian White is expecting a resurgent Wales to give him a rough ride in England's Six Nations opener in Cardiff on Saturday.

Injuries have taken their toll and coach Andy Robinson has been deprived of Richard Hill, Jonny Wilkinson, Martin Corry, Mike Tindall, Will Greenwood and Stuart Abbott.

Leicester, who signed White from Bristol when the West Country side were relegated from the Zurich Premiership in the summer of 2003, have also been aided by White's presence this season.He destroyed South Africa's Os du Randt in the scrum at Twickenham last autumn to give England the platform for an impressive 32-16 victory.And with 27 caps and a World Cup winner's medal to his name, White is now in a position to offer his experience to youngsters such as centres Matthew Tait and Jamie Noon.The 31-year-old has made a massive contribution to the England and Leicester cause of late and is arguably the form tight-head prop in the world.

""I don't know how much experience a tight-head can give a centre but you are there to give them a pat on the back if things go wrong or to be there if they want to talk in any way,"" he added."

Two moments of magic from Brian O'Driscoll guided Ireland to a workmanlike victory against Italy.

Roland de Marigny took over the kicking duties for Italy from the hapless Orquera, and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge Italy into a 9-8 lead.

The Ireland captain ran a dummy scissors and made a magical outside break before drawing the full-back and putting the diving Murphy in at the corner."

Robinson, a former rugby league international before switching codes in 2000, leads England against Australia at Twickenham at 1430 GMT.Britain have won individual Test matches, but have failed to secure any silverware or win the Ashes (with a series victory) since 1970.

The tourists won their early games with a quick-thinking, inventive approach, but press criticism began to grow over their 2-3-2 scrum formation that left a 'roving' forward free to disrupt opposition attacks.An excellent try on the left wing by Teddy Morgan sealed a 3-0 win in a hard-fought encounter at Cardiff Arms Park, but post-match talk was dominated by a Bob Deans try that was ruled out by Scottish referee John Dallas.In 1888 a British team led by AE Stoddart toured New Zealand and Australia, and soon after a Maori named Joe Warbrick and an English ex-pat called Thomas Eyton decided to gather a combined New Zealand team.

The first South Africa tour of New Zealand in 1921 saw honours shared in a three-Test series, starting the greatest rivalry in rugby - and the long-running controversy between the countries over the All Blacks' inclusion of Maori players.The Kiwis shocked the rugby world with a 9-3 triumph in Wellington, sparking great celebrations across the country, but Bedell-Sivright churlishly suggested that the victors would have no chance when they visited the UK.

While England did not hit the heights in Dallaglio's second spell as captain, losing five of their eight post-World Cup Tests, Dallaglio led by example, leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many World Cup stars to live up to expectations.Displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years, Dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three back-row positions at international standard.

Although players like Joe Worsley and Chris Jones are more than capable of stepping up, the fact that there is no stand-out candidate speaks volumes about Dallaglio's massive influence on English rugby.
Rumours began to circulate that his career was over but, in typical Dallaglio style, he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen.The only player to play every minute of England's World Cup triumph in Australia, Dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure England's historic win, and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by England supporters.Dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of England's most accomplished players, if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country.

England won the first Rugby World Cup Sevens in 1993 with a side that included the likes of Lawrence Dallaglio and Matt Dawson.The top two sides in each pool qualify but England could face 2001 winners New Zealand in the quarter-finals if they stumble against Samoa.""We have not performed consistently to our true potential so far in the IRB Sevens which has been disappointing - but we can only look forward.""However, they beat Samoa in the recent Los Angeles Sevens before losing to Argentina in the semi-finals."
1713,"Henson was also creativity personified: one little chip ahead for Shane Williams narrowly missed its target; a precise cross-kick forcing Jamie Noon to fumble the ball into touch.Showing awesome strength, Henson nonchantly held the bewildered debutant in mid-air, a master predator toying with his helpless prey, savouring the kill.Five metres in from the right touchline, 44 metres out, it was not a kick Stephen Jones, who had seen a long-range effort fall agonisingly under the bar, would have approached with confidence.The ""Red Dragonhood"" subdued the ""Red Rose Army"" in most areas of the field, but Henson's stellar performance ensured their efforts yielded the win they craved above all others.The second time, after the interval, single-handedly lifted the record Millennium Stadium crowd at a time when England were starting to show menace.And if his natural self-assurance and swagger is shared by his Wales team-mates, then a full-blown revival could be more than just a lot of hot air drifting up from the Valleys.The England centre will have spent his 19th birthday on Sunday shuddering at the memory of how he was up-ended not just once, but twice, by Henson's all-enveloping tackles.

1714,"Tri-Nations rivals Australia, New Zealand and South Africa would feature prominently in a southern team against a northern side comprised of Six Nations teams France, Ireland, England, Wales, Italy and Scotland.""We still need to discuss the options with the IRB (International Rugby Board), the Lions and our SANZAR (South Africa, New Zealand and Australia Rugby) partners, but June or July is seen as a better option than March to ensure we have the cream of southern hemisphere rugby available,"" he said.Sydney to host north v south game

Sydney will host a northern versus southern hemisphere charity match in June or July, the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) said on Wednesday.

Almost 80,000 fans packed into Melbourne Cricket Ground on 10 January for a charity match that raised Â£5.9m for victims of the Asian tsunami.
ARU chief executive Gary Flowers said the world cricket charity match in Melbourne earlier this month had inspired the ARU.""The Australian Rugby Union has thrown its support behind a proposed North-South match to raise funds for the tsunami appeals,"" the ARU said.Coach Clive Woodward's Lions squad will tour New Zealand in June and July, including Tests on 25 June, 2 and 9 July.

The Six Nations has heralded a new order in northern hemisphere rugby this year and Wales and Ireland rather than traditional big guns France and England face a potential Grand Slam play-off in three weeks' time.

But before that game in Cardiff, Wales must get past Scotland at Murrayfield, while Ireland face the not insignificant task of a home fixture with the mercurial French.Wales' most recent championship title was in 1994, and their last Grand Slam success came in 1978 in the era of Gareth Edwards, Phil Bennett, JPR Williams et al.

Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan and captain Brian O'Driscoll have got their side buzzing too, and they are close to shedding the ""nearly-men"" tag that has dogged them for the past few years.England are enduring their worst run in the championship since captain Richard Hill was dumped in favour of Mike Harrison after three straight losses in 1987.No-one knows what mood France will be in at Lansdowne Road on 12 March - sublime, as in the first half against Wales, or ridiculous, like in the same period against England at Twickenham."
1716,"Ireland win eclipses refereeing 'errors'

The International Rugby Board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly-up.

England coach Andy Robinson referred to a similar case at Ravenhill in January when Ulster were playing Gloucester in the Heineken Cup.Brian O'Driscoll's winning try was as well-conceived as they come, while Charlie Hodgson's brilliant kicking display was another highlight.It was the same for Simon McDowell, the touch judge who was heavily criticised by Scotland coach Matt Williams after their defeat against France.The referee also missed England's Danny Grewcock taking out Ronan O'Gara off the ball to allow Martin Corry a Sunday stroll to the line.However, one has to credit Ireland flanker Johnny O'Connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown.There was no doubt that Ireland had the rub of the green in their 19-13 victory, but the reaction from the England camp may not have endeared them to the sport's ""blazers""."
1717,"In front of a supercharged home crowd on a dry but blustery day in Dublin, Ireland tore into the white-shirted visitors from the kick-off and made their intentions clear when O'Gara landed a fourth-minute drop-goal.

England fly-half Charlie Hodgson nailed the conversion from out on the left, but almost immediately O'Gara, winning his 50th cap, answered with two penalties in quick succession.Ireland raced upfield, deft handling from the backs, including a clever dummy from Geordan Murphy on Hodgson, ending with O'Driscoll going over in the right corner and touching down close to the posts.O'Gara missed a penalty which would have put Ireland nine points clear, and the home crowd breathed a sigh of relief when Hodgson's cross-kick was fumbled by lock Ben Kay near the line.G Murphy; G Dempsey, B O'Driscoll, S Horgan, D Hickie; R O'Gara, P Stringer; R Corrigan, S Byrne, J Hayes; M O'Kelly, P O'Connell; S Easterby, J O'Connor, A Foley.

England coach Andy Robinson said he was ""livid"" after his side were denied two tries in Sunday's 19-13 Six Nations loss to Ireland in Dublin.

Kaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when Josh Lewsey took the ball over the Irish line under a pile of bodies for what could have been the game-winning try.Mark Cueto's first-half effort was ruled out for offside before the referee spurned TV replays when England crashed over in the dying minutes.Matt Stevens had an awesome game at tighthead prop, while the likes of Charlie Hodgson, Martin Corry and Lewis Moody all came through well.England have lost their first three matches in this year's Six Nations and four out of their six games since Robinson took over from Sir Clive Woodward in September.

In an effort to live up to its reputation in the 1990s as ""an island of democracy"", the Kyrgyz President, Askar Akaev, pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming Parliamentary and Presidential elections.The Kyrgyz Republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mid-1990s with a hastily pushed through referendum in 2003, reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with 75 deputies.At the entrance to each polling station, one election official will scan voter's fingers with UV lamp before allowing them to enter, and every voter will have his/her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot.Widely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep - a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society.

Telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light-moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high-volume manufacturing have been solved.While work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around, before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances.But the Intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light.Dr Paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it, some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material.Scientists at Intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light."

The system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed, said Sun's chief operating officer Jonathan Schwartz.""Why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour?"" he asked in a webcast launching Sun's quarterly Network Computing event in California.Mr Schwartz ran a demonstration of the service, showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment.Initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers."

Online soccer fans will testify to that, between bouts of arguing over which high-profile title rules supreme out of the similar-yet-hugely-different FIFA 2005 and Pro Evolution Soccer 4.On the same note, the ESPN 2k5 and EA sports games have so little to choose between them that picking favourites will come down to players' personal preferences and spending budget rather than any technical elements.In terms of gameplay, I marginally preferred EA's NBA Live 2005 for basketball, and was more satisfied ice hockey-wise by ESPN's NHL 2K5."

Despite having no remit for the regulation of net content, disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by Ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option.Internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the Law Commission dubbed them ""mere conduits"" back in 2002.Some studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the UK could have adopted broadband by the end of 2005, and the technology opens the door to TV content delivered over the net.At the debate, organised by the Internet Service Providers' Association (ISPA), Lord Currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation.

Another feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling.

But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision.Unlike commercially available voice recognition software, Opera does not have to be ""trained"" to recognise an individual voice.Opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from Norwegian telecoms company Telenor.Its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms.

All 28 people detained globally are suspected of being involved in an internet-based network which stole people's identities and used computers and websites to defraud credit card companies.Chief Supt Deats went on to warn: ""The internet offers huge legitimate benefits for modern society; however with it brings powerful opportunities for those seeking to abuse those benefits for criminal gain.Dozens held over ID fraud site

Twenty-eight people, including a Briton, have been arrested after a global operation against a website allegedly involved in identity fraud.

1945,"Incidents like this happen, said Mr Thiemann, because when banks start using Windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers.US laws that demand disabled people get equal access to information will also force banks to make their cash machines more versatile and able to present information in different ways.Risks of infection were small because the data networks that connect UK cash machines together and the operators of the ATMs themselves were a much smaller and tightly-knit community than in the US where viruses have struck.
There are also other pressures making banks turn to Windows said Dominic Hirsch, managing director of financial analysis firm Retail Banking Research.

He said many cash machines will also have to be upgraded to make full use of the new Europay, Mastercard and Visa credit cards that use computer chips instead of magnetic stripes to store data.In January 2003 the Slammer worm knocked out 13,000 cash machines of the Bank of America and many of those operated by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.A spokesman for the Association of Payment and Clearing Services (Apacs) which represents the UK's payments industry said the risk from viruses was minimal."
1946,"Attack prompts Bush site block

The official re-election site of President George W Bush is blocking visits from overseas users for ""security reasons"".

About the same time the web team of the Bush-Cheney campaign started using the services of a company called Akamai that helps websites deal with the ebbs and flows of visitor traffic.The international exclusion zone around georgewbush.com was spotted by net monitoring firm Netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites.

Mike Prettejohn, Netcraft president, speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs, and traffic, in the run-up to the election on 2 November.Netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 October attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in London, Amsterdam and Sydney have failed.The policy of trying to stop overseas visitors viewing the site is thought to have been adopted in response to an attack on the georgewbush.com website.The barring of non-US visitors has led to the campaign being inundated with calls and forced it to make a statement about why the blocking was taking place."
1947,"""Parents could pre-pay for some content, as a kind of TV pocket money card,"" said Nigel Whalley, managing director of media consultancy Decipher.

Loyalty cards could play a role in this, particularly in reducing the number of people who cancel their Sky subscriptions, said Ian Fogg, an analyst with Jupiter Research.
Loyalty cards have become a common addition to most wallets, as High Street brands rush to keep customers with a series of incentives offered by store cards.For the BBC, revenue-generating activity will be of little interest but the new development may prompt changes to Freeview set-top boxes, said Mr Whalley.Viewers could even be rewarded for watching ad breaks, with ideas such as ad bingo being touted by firms keen to make money out of the new market, said Mr Whalley.Broadcasters aiming content at children could offer smartcards which gives membership to exclusive content and clubs.Sky will activate a spare slot on set-top boxes in January, marketing magazine New Media Age reported.

1948,"Previous Star Wars titles like the acclaimed Knights Of The Old Republic and Jedi Knight have regularly impressed with their imaginative forays into the far corners of the franchise's extensive universe, and their use of weird and wonderful new characters.The Force is strong in Battlefront

The warm reception that has greeted Star Wars: Battlefront is a reflection not of any ingenious innovation in its gameplay, but of its back-to-basics approach and immense nostalgia quotient.

The mayhem can be viewed from either a third or first-person perspective, and you can either fight for the forces of freedom or join Darth Vader on the Dark Side, depending on the episode and type of campaign as well as the player's personal propensity for good or evil.

The sights, sounds and protagonists on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans, who may well feel that the opportunity to relive Star Wars' most memorable screen skirmishes makes this the game they have always waited for.Locations include the frozen wastes of Hoth, the ice planet from The Empire Strikes Back, complete with massive mechanical AT-ATs on the march.Geared towards online gamers, it is based around little more than a series of all-out gunfights, set in an array of locations all featured in, or hinted at during, the two blockbusting film trilogies.The above-average AI of the enemy sees to that, although given the frenetic environments they operate in, their strategic behaviour does not need to be all that sophisticated."

The once-famous Commodore computer brand could be resurrected after being bought by a US-based digital music distributor.

Tulip Computers sold several products under the Commodore name, including portable USB storage devices and digital music players.Commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for Windows PC, Apple Mac and even PDAs so that the original Commodore games can be still run.In the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to Atari, which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games, formerly known as Infogrames.

Commodore International filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to Dutch firm Tulip Computers.New owner Yeahronimo Media Ventures has not ruled out the possibility of a new breed of Commodore computers.The groundbreaking Commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s.

1974,"Online journals also raised doubts about documents used by US television news organisation CBS in a story about President Bush's war record.One of the reasons that blogs and regularly updated online journals have become popular is because the software used to put them together make it very easy for people to air their views online.Statistics by web influence ranking firm HitWise reveal that the most popular political blog racks up only 0.0051% of all net visits per day.Merriam-Webster defines a blog as: ""a Web site that contains an online personal journal with reflections, comments and often hyperlinks"".According to blog analysis firm Technorati the number of blogs in existence, the blogosphere, has doubled every five and a half months for the last 18 months.A spokesman for the Oxford University Press said that the word was now being put into other dictionaries for children and learners, reflecting its mainstream use.Other words on the Merriam-Webster list were associated with major news events such as the US presidential election or natural disasters that hit the US.

1975,"New Year's texting breaks record

A mobile phone was as essential to the recent New Year's festivities as a party mood and Auld Lang Syne, if the number of text messages sent is anything to go by.

For those still wanting to drink and be merry as the long days of winter draw in, the Good Pub Guide offers a service giving the location and address of their nearest recommended pub.The British love affair with texting shows no signs of abating and the annual total for 2004 is set to exceed 25bn, according to MDA.Wishing a Happy New Year to friends and family via text message has become a staple ingredient of the year's largest party.Anyone in need of a bit of January cheer now the party season is over, can use a service set up by Jongleurs comedy club, which will text them a joke a day.There were also lots of messages sent internationally, where different time zones made traditional calls unfeasible, he said.While texting has not quite overtaken the old-fashioned phone call, it is heading that way, said Mike Short, chairman of the MDA."

The mobile gaming industry is set to explode in 2005 with a number of high-profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback.Hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices, Ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers.""We believe the DS will appeal to all ages, both genders and gamers of any skill,"" said David Yarnton, Nintendo Europe's general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld.The Japanese gaming giant hopes the DS will maintain the firm's pre-eminence in an increasingly-competitive mobile gaming market.

Sony will enter the market later this year with its PlayStation Portable, while start-up companies Gizmondo and Tapwave Zodiac are also offering hybrid devices.With its two screens, wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the GameBoy Advance, the DS certainly has a number of unique selling points.Nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen.

1977,"On our test machine - an Alienware system with an Athlon 3500+ processor and ATI's Radeon X800 video card - everything ran at full quality without trouble, and the visual experience was simply jaw-dropping.A lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue, which makes for exciting moments, but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once you've completed it.Having survived that skirmish in an desolate monster-infested research facility, he's back in another foreboding troublespot - the enigmatic City 17.At times Half-Life 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to, and in a curious way, its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome.Whereas the highly impressive Doom III felt like a top-notch theme park thrill-ride, wandering through Half-Life's world truly does feel like being part of a movie.

Underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective, and immerses the player in the most vivid, convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen.It is not simply that the surfaces, textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy, but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them."

1979,"Despite Suprnova administrator Sloncek's involvement with Exeem, the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called Swarm Systems that is based on Caribbean island Saint Kitts and Nevis.

Mr Pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading.One of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the BitTorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or TV programmes they claimed to.

Dr Johan Pouwelse, a researcher at the Delft University of Technology who studies peer-to-peer networks, said Exeem was the next evolution in file-sharing systems.He added that the legal attacks on BitTorrent had driven people away from sites such as Suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic.In late December movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the BitTorrent network.In an interview with Novastream web radio, Sloncek said Exeem would combine ideas from the BitTorrent and Kazaa file-sharing systems."

This was the case with the one he created for a political party in Uruguay, Cambiemos, an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the country's problems could be solved by working together.""Video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new, but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation,"" Mr Frasca told the BBC News website.""I must admit that I was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved,"" added the Uruguayan-born researcher, who has so far created games for two political campaigns."

1987,"The two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law, so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes, or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity theft.Fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office, plugging it into a USB slot and sucking down customer files.

The Financial Services Authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data.And as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements, banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details.Identity theft is an increasingly significant economic crime, and we are all becoming more aware of the dangers of leaving bills, receipts and bank statements unshredded in our rubbish.

Whether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job, the issue is the same: how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused?Armed with the personal details that a bank holds, plus a fake letter or two, it is apparently easy to get a loan, open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else's name."

The report concluded that the driving force behind the growth of Europe's portable player market was likely to be music, rather than films or any combination of the two.A separate report by Jupiter forecasts that the European digital music market will grow to 836m euros (Â£581m) by 2009."
2007,"But speed is only a small part of the attraction of broadband, and when it comes to checking websites for film times, looking at weather forecasts, or all of the other small things that make a real difference to the routines and habits of our daily lives, even UK speeds are sufficient.With no modem installed in her computer, she had to borrow internet access from friends or use the dial-up connection on her daughter's laptop, so she had to choose between copying her files onto her USB memory card or accepting a slower and flakier net connection.More and more of these broadband users are beginning to mould their daily lives around the availability of broadband internet connections, and they too will find it difficult to cope if they cannot get online for any reason.

Learning to love broadband

We are reaching the point where broadband is a central part of daily life, at least for some, argues technology analyst Bill Thompson.

In South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong normal connection speeds are measured in megabits, or millions of bits, a second rather than the thousands that we are supposed to be happy with.We checked the cable modem and noticed that it had no power, and when she changed the power lead it sparked at her in a way which made it abundantly clear that it was never going to talk to the internet again.And I can spend the day working with my girlfriend Anne, a children's writer, at her house in Cambridge, sharing her wireless network."

Sony will enter the market later this year with its PlayStation Portable, while start-up companies Gizmondo and Tapwave Zodiac are also offering hybrid devices.With its two screens, wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the GameBoy Advance, the DS certainly has a number of unique selling points.Nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen.

Computer giant Microsoft has launched a pilot scheme to replace counterfeit versions of Windows XP with legal ones.

In June, the software giant said that the major security update to Windows XP, Service Pack 2, would not work with the most widely pirated versions of its operating system.The upgrade closed security loopholes in XP and added features that made it easier to keep machines safe from viruses and other types of malicious computer code.

It is the first time Microsoft has launched a counterfeit product replacement scheme in the world, the company told the BBC News website.The Windows XP Counterfeit Project will mean that software that is found to be counterfeit will be replaced for free, subject to certain conditions, until the end of the year."

Half-Life 2 was officially released on 16 November but before gamers could get to grips with the long-awaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online.Valve spokesman Doug Lombardi said that the company had not yet released sales figures for the game and would not say what proportion of all Steam players the 20,000 represented.Authentication involved setting up an account with Valve's gaming community system called Steam and letting that check which copy of the game was being run.

All too often, you will perform a stunning triple somersault, pirouette off a wall, knock out three enemies in one glorious swoop, before plummeting purposefully over a cliff to your doom.Gritty return for Prince of Persia

Still basking in the relatively recent glory of last year's Sands Of Time, the dashing Prince of Persia is back in Warrior Within, and in a more bellicose mood than last time.

The game's developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways.The only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry Empress Of Time before she ever creates the Sands of Time that caused the great beast's creation.

Studiously structured though this back story is, everything boils down to old-fashioned fantasy gameplay which proves, on the whole, as dependable as it needs to be.Within is a very slick package; the game's intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences.

By far the most satisfying element of the game is seeing old favourites like Dr No, Goldfinger, hat-fiend Oddjob and crazed Russian sex beast Xenia Onatopp resurrected after all these years, and with their faces rendered in an impressively recognisable fashion.

With a determination to justify its name which is even less convincing than that of Tina Turner's similarly-titled theme song, the game literally gives the player a golden eye following an injury, which enables a degree of X-ray vision.

Given James Bond's healthy pedigree in past games, there is every reason to hope that this is just a blip, a commendable idea that just has not worked, that will be rectified when the character inevitably makes his return.

It is perhaps indicative of a lack of confidence that the game maker's allow you several different weapons almost immediately and throw you quickly into raging firefights - no time is risked with a measured build-up.

Shooting enemies from a distance can be tricky, and you will not always know you have picked them off, since dead enemies vanish literally before they have fully hit the floor, and they do so in some woefully uninspiring death animations.Rogue Agent signals its intentions by featuring James Bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments, squashed by a plummeting helicopter."

Movie studio efforts to stop pirated films being shared on peer-to-peer networks have claimed a high-profile victim.

Phoenix Torrents, another popular BitTorrent site, has also decided to shut down and, though it gave no reasons for the closure, it is thought to be motivated by the threat of legal action.In the opening days of the MPAA campaign, the organisation filed 100 lawsuits against operators of BitTorrent server site.Because of the way that BitTorrent works, server sites do not host the actual file being shared, instead they host a link that points people to others that have it.A recent study showed that more than half of the peer-to-peer traffic during June was for the BitTorrent system.

The research centre, which was started by the Irish government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a hotbed for technology concepts.Many concepts fed into science, engineering, and psychology as well as technology, but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near-term.Prime Minister Bertie Ahern had wanted to the centre to become a big draw for smaller hi-tech companies, in an attempt to regenerate the area.

I've just looked around my office and I find two monitors, an old 386 PC, two old handhelds, three ancient laptops, four antique mobile phones, a collection of rechargeable batteries and even a Sun workstation that is no longer really much use.We have a long and depressing history of developing new technologies with complete disregard for their potential impact on the environment, and waiting until there is a crisis looming before we try to redesign them to cause less damage.And work is going into making power supplies that are more energy efficient, since current transformers are astonishingly wasteful as they charge our laptops, mobiles and music players.

Microsoft's Windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of.People who try to manually download security patches will have to let Microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number.

Telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light-moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high-volume manufacturing have been solved.While work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around, before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances.But the Intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light.Intel unveils laser breakthrough
