1,"Dollar gains on Greenspan speech

The dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the Federal Reserve head said the US trade deficit is set to stabilise.

China's currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency's sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive.""I think the chairman's taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he's taken for some time,"" said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York.The White House will announce its budget on Monday, and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars.
But calls for a shift in Beijing's policy have fallen on deaf ears, despite recent comments in a major Chinese newspaper that the ""time is ripe"" for a loosening of the peg.Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months.The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the US's yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments."

Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA's estimated annual surcharge revenues - Â£160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra Â£250m.

Air passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation.

Andy Clarke, ERAA director of air transport, said that the EC advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.

However, only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations.

The EU decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights.In addition, if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline, all passengers must be paid compensation.

Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has warned that allowing huge US budget deficits to continue could have ""severe"" consequences.

Speaking to the House Budget Committee he urged Congress to take action to cut the deficit, such as increasing taxes.He called on Congress to cut promised benefits for retirees, as the promised benefits for the soon-to-retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford.

Meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending, he added.Recent increases in defence and homeland security spending were also not expected to continue indefinitely, which should cut some costs.As US growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit.""I fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the baby-boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver."

The price of crude is still up about 30% on the start of 2004, but has fallen from the record of $55.67 set in late October.The falls were triggered when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that US crude stocks were 3.5% higher than a year ago.Weak US fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in pushing up oil prices."

However, retailers' attempts to draw in the crowds may be behind November's unexpected rise in sales, they say.The ONS data confounded analyst expectations.Aggressive tactics, such as one-day discount sales adopted by stores such as Marks & Spencer, appear to have paid off."

Ten years of ""golden"" economic performance may come to an end in 2005 with growth slowing markedly, City consultancy Deloitte has warned.

""Whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth, this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace.Deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2% this year, below Chancellor Gordon Brown's forecast of 3% to 3.5%.This will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year, when the economy expanded by 3.25%.""

Economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes, Deloitte believes.Deloitte's chief economic advisor Roger Bootle said: ""The biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown.The UK economy could suffer a backlash from the slowdown in the housing market, triggering a fall in consumer spending and a rise in unemployment."

Thousands of public bodies are ill-prepared for the Freedom of Information Act, due to come into force next month, because of government failures, say MPs.

""Our report shows that in the past support and guidance from the DCA, which has overall responsibility for guiding the public sector through the process of implementation for the freedom of information regime, has been lacking.""Committee chairman Alan Beith said: ""The DCA has had four years to prepare for freedom of information, but with less than a month to go it appears that some bodies may not be well enough prepared.From next month anyone will have the power to demand information from a range of public bodies - from Whitehall departments to doctors' surgeries.The DCA had ""failed"" to provide early guidance on technical matters and shown a ""lack of consistent leadership"", the MPs found.But the government department responsible for implementing the change suffered from an ""unusually high turnover"" of staff within the department, which had ""seriously interfered"" with its work, said the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee.""

A group of MPs and peers has called for a tightening of regulations controlling betting on sport.

""You could get a bigger sentence for failing to pay your hotel bill criminally than you could for corruption in major sports.Lord Faulkner of Worcester, who chaired the inquiry, said: ""Whilst we accept that the greater part of sports betting is neither corrupt nor unfair to punters, the evidence convinces us that the growth of betting exchanges - because of the facility they provide to bet against a result - has increased the potential for corruption.Lord Condon, head of the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit, who originally made the call for longer prison sentences, said the two-year penalty was ""derisory"".The panel's aim was to try to define what constitutes cheating, assess how much might be going on and suggest what the government might do to put it right."

Military chiefs are expected to meet to make a final decision on the future of Scotland's Army regiments.

For a brief time, there was speculation the prime minister might consider the plan, but that now seems unlikely.In October, the Council of Scottish Colonels proposed the merger of the Royal Scots and the King's Own Scottish Borderers into a single battalion.

""They are very much not for the good and will destroy Scotland's regiments by moulding them into a single super regiment which will lead to severe recruitment problems, a loss of local connections to those regiments and a loss to Scotland of an important part of her heritage and, most importantly, her future - the regiments are the envy of armies around the world.""The proposals include cutting Scotland's six single-battalion regiments to five and merging these into a super regiment.The proposals to either merge or amalgamate the six regiments into a super regiment sparked a political outcry, with Labour backbenchers and opposition politicians opposing the plan.He said: ""They don't want to get rid of the history or the traditions of the regiment or the local connections - far from it, all they want to do is make sure they can transfer people easily across regiments and deploy them more flexibly."""

The government has announced plans to cut 100,000 civil servants as part of its efficiency drive.""Far from improving public services, spending taxpayers' money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats, more regulation and higher taxes.""""Cuts on this scale cannot be found from cutting 'bureaucracy' but would require massive cuts to front-line public services such as schools, hospitals and the police.""""

Labour will continue to pursue controversial reforms if it wins a third term in power, the party's election chief Alan Milburn has said.

Mr Milburn told Today that Labour wanted policies which encouraged increased social mobility in Britain.

Mr Milburn gave more details of planned reforms in a speech to Labour's Fabian Society, in which he also praised Mr Brown as one of the leaders of the party's reform process.""No-one is talking about driving people into work but what we do know is there are one million people on incapacity benefit who want the opportunity to work, providing the right level of support is there for them"".Oliver Letwin said the government had failed to deliver in any of the key public services, such as cleaner hospitals, discipline in schools and putting more police on the streets.Mr Milburn insisted that government reform must continue.Pressed on incapacity benefits, he said the tax and welfare system must ""provide the right incentives to people""."

With impeccable and precisely-calculated timing, Tory defector Robert Jackson and his new Labour bosses have attempted to overshadow Michael Howard's latest announcement on taxation and spending.

Tory leader Michael Howard says his party can save Â£35bn in government spending by tackling waste.

The money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the NHS and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes.""Almost every independent expert says if you get another Labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes,"" Mr Howard insisted.The Â£12bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing, he added.However, Chief Treasury Secretary Paul Boateng said: ""None of the Tories' figures add up so they can't make these savings and can't pay for any tax cuts, which means the only guaranteed cut from the Tories is Â£35bn of cuts, hitting frontline public services hard.""The cuts will be paid for out of the savings identified by business trouble-shooter David James.""

Mr Howard is expected to say that around Â£6bn will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on Monday."
1167,"But Mr Kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible, costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax, crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name.
They would argue that, by the time of the election after next, the Liberal Democrats may genuinely have replaced the Tories as the party challenging Labour for power.On the war on Iraq, identity cards, student fees and the council tax, there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the Liberal Democrats offered costed, sensible alternatives.But the Liberal Democrats are entering the expected 2005 election campaign determined to prove it is they, not the Tories, who are now the real threat to Labour.Sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test.

The other parties will still insist that the Lib Dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats.

The ""best person for the job"" should be appointed lord chancellor, and not necessarily a lawyer or MP, the courts minister has told MPs.

In December the Lords rejected a plea by current Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer that the holder of the job should not necessarily be a lawyer or a peer.""The lord chancellor...no more needs to be a lawyer than the Secretary of Health needs to be a doctor,"" said courts minister Christopher Leslie.He warned that unless ministers backed down over the lord chancellor remaining a member of the House of Lords, the government would have ""great difficulty"" in getting the Bill through Parliament.Under reforms, the post of lord chancellor is to be stripped of its judicial functions.Mr Leslie said it was irrelevant whether the post was called Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs or Lord Chancellor.Under the reforms, the Law Lords will also be replaced as the UK's highest legal authority by a Supreme Court and judges will be appointed by an independent panel rather than ministers.

Educated at Eton, and at New College, Oxford, he served in the Scots Guards from 1941 to 1945 and was wounded in tanks in Normandy.He worked under Edward Heath on Europe at the Foreign Office and subsequently won the Eton and Slough seat for the Tories in 1964 - by 11 votes.His prospects of a front bench slot remained remote because he tended to defy the party line.
That in turn paved the way for John Major to move into 10 Downing Street, after the second ballot.Meyer's constituency party, Clwyd North West, which he had represented as an MP for more than 20 years, deselected him as a result of that challenge.Labour regained the seat two years later, and Meyer had to wait until 1970 before he could re-enter Parliament."

UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has defended plans to end the European Union's arms embargo on China, despite opposition from the US and Japan.

The French want the embargo lifted because they want to sell arms to China; the Chinese want it lifted because they want to buy arms and battlefield technology from Europe.""But Mr Straw insisted the EU's code of conduct on arms exports meant tough criteria on human rights still had to be met if the embargo was lifted.
Washington argues that if the embargo is lifted, it could lead to a buying spree for arms that China could use to threaten its diplomatic rival Taiwan.Washington has also voiced concern that the human rights conditions in China have not improved enough to merit an end to the embargo.Earlier this week he said he expected the embargo to be lifted within six months.

Mr Brown and Mr Blair staged a show of unity on Thursday morning, the day after the chancellor delivered a record-breaking ninth Budget.

Elderly and disabled people would choose how their own budget for personal care was spent and organised under government plans.

They also plan a supremo for adult services in each English area to get different agencies working together.The Tories say people who pay for three years' long-term care directly or through insurance should be guaranteed free care for the rest of their lives.He ruled out free personal care in England - which is on offer in Scotland and Wales, saying it was ""unsustainable"".

It could cost Â£80m to run a UK referendum on the European constitution, ministers have revealed.

Mr Brown, on a week-long tour of Africa, spent two days in Tanzania before heading on Friday evening to Mozambique, a country where more than half of the 17-million population lives below the poverty line.

""We make this offer unilaterally but we are now asking other countries to join us,"" the chancellor said.South African president Thabo Mbeki has attacked British imperialists, saying they treated Africans like savages.The UK has pledged to pay 10% of the developing world's foreign debt bill in an attempt to fight poverty."

Wales hooker Mefin Davies is likely to stay with English side Gloucester despite reported interest from the Neath-Swansea Ospreys.

The summer demise of the Celtic Warriors region left Davies in the cold and forced him to take a semi-professional contract with Neath RFC.""
Although he got match time with the Ospreys at the request of the Wales management, he admitted before his move to Gloucester that he was angry with the way he was treated.""It was a hard time throughout the summer, then deciding whether to accept an offer from Stade Francais which would have ended my Wales career.BBC Wales understands the Ospreys are interested in the 32-year-old, but that he would prefer to stay where he is.Davies, one of the stars of Saturday's RBS Six Nations win over England, is only on a year contract at Kingsholm."
1610,"The Scotland coach said his side were robbed of victory by poor decisions made by the officials.Six Nations match has defended the officials' handling of the game after criticism by Matt Williams.

But Nigel Williams told the Scottish Daily Mail: ""I spoke to Matt Williams at the post-match dinner.""If Matt has issues with the match officials, then he is very welcome to phone me and discuss them.Nonetheless, he was furious about several decisions that he felt denied his side a famous victory.""
""That is the beginning and end of it."
1611,"The Bath fly-half-cum-centre is likely to start against France, with either Tait or Noon dropping out.

Robinson ready for difficult task

England coach Andy Robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the Six Nations defeat by Wales.

Lock Ben Kay also justified his recall with an impressive all-round display on his return to the side, but elsewhere England positives were thin on the ground.
Robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the 11-9 loss as he contemplates Sunday's set-to with France at Twickenham.It is more likely the Leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the French forwards, with Andy Hazell likely to make way.Tait himself, at least outwardly, appeared unaffected by the punishing treatment dished out to him by Gavin Henson in particular.""Hopefully I can train hard this week and get selected for next week but we'll have to look at the video and wait and see."
1612,"Bell set for England debut

Bath prop Duncan Bell has been added to England's 30-man squad to face Ireland in the RBS Six Nations.

He was due to have a hospital scan on Monday, while Gloucester centre Henry Paul, who started at fly-half against Bath, limped out at Kingsholm because of an ankle problem.Bell, 30, had set his sights on an international career with Wales.Robinson also has an injury worry over centre Olly Barkley, who withdrew from Bath's starting line-up to face Gloucester last weekend.

Despite Barkley's three missed penalties in the 18-17 defeat against France, he is expected to retain his place at inside centre, although Leicester's in-form prospect Ollie Smith would be an obvious replacement.France A 30-20 nine days ago - to be drafted in.England coach Andy Robinson could take a gamble and call inexperienced Sale Sharks prop Andrew Sheridan into his front row."

O'Sullivan quick to hail Italians

Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan heaped praise on Italy after seeing his side stutter to a 28-17 victory in Rome.

""We had our first attack in the Italian half after 22 minutes,"" said O'Sullivan.""It was a hell of a tough game,"" said O'Sullivan.""We struggled in the first half because we hadn't the football.Scrum-half Peter Stringer was also glad that Ireland escaped wtih a victory.They always give us a tough game here and they showed a lot of spirit."
1614,"A penalty apiece saw Ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter, but they were lucky to survive when Italy launched a series of attacks.It could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and Ireland drew level with a Ronan O'Gara penalty midway through the first half.The Italians were driving at the heart of the Irish defence and, for the first quarter, the Irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs.

Roland de Marigny took over the kicking duties for Italy from the hapless Orquera, and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge Italy into a 9-8 lead.

Italy led 9-8 early in the second half but Stringer's try gave Ireland a lead they never lost.Italy 17-28 Ireland

Two moments of magic from Brian O'Driscoll guided Ireland to a workmanlike victory against Italy.

Wales centre Sonny Parker and number eight Ryan Jones will miss Saturday's game with Italy because of injury.

""
""I'm glad it's a short week before the Italy game.The centre was Wales' hero in the 11-9 Six Nations win over England, landing a huge late penalty from wide out to clinch the game.Parker has not recovered from a trapped nerve in his neck that kept him out of the win over England, and Tom Shanklin is expected to continue at centre.Henson himself says he is relishing all the media hype that has been heaped on him since last Saturday's game."

France have brought flanker Serge Betsen back into their squad to face England at Twickenham on Sunday.

""We missed Serge badly against Scotland.The trio have been called up after Pieter de Villiers, Ludovic Valbon and Aurelien Rougerie all picked up injuries in France's 16-9 win on Saturday.

""If he was to be suspended, we would call up Imanol Harinordoquy or Thomas Lievremont,"" said Laporte, who has dropped Patrick Tabacco."
1619,"Wales critical of clumsy Grewcock

Wales coach Mike Ruddock says England lock Danny Grewcock needs to review his actions after he kicked Dwayne Peel.

""Our first aim was to get Gavin settled into the team, but it's something we'll talk about in selection this week,"" said Ruddock.
Trouble flared at a ruck in the first half of Wales' 11-9 win in Cardiff as Grewcock came recklessly over the top with his boot, leaving Peel bloodied.Six years earlier, also in New Zealand, Grewcock became only the second England player to be sent off in Tests.""He's a great player and I don't want to knock him, we won't be calling for the match commissioner to review the incident.But Ruddock feels that the England man should be more careful.""I'm not going to go too far with the lad."

but I think you could get a Henson, D'Arcy, O'Driscoll combination in the Lions midfield.Henson stakes early Lions claim

The Six Nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four Home Unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to New Zealand with the Lions this summer.

Wales fly-half Stephen Jones was another player who impressed me.He once showed a clean pair of heels to Mathew Tait when he got outside him, his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand.He showed he can control a game.Hogg made a couple of good runs while White had a pretty robust game - his defence is right up there."
1621,"So really we went back to playing a territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball.That new ruck law made it a bit more difficult to get out of our own half.Murphy: That was a bruising battle

That's what I call a tough game.It was very physical and fair play to the Italians they made us work very hard for our victory.

It was great work by Brian and I always knew I had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee.It's always good to score.It was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it."
1622,"Wales make two changes for France

Wales coach Mike Ruddock has made two changes from the team that beat Italy 38-8 for Saturday's trip to France.

And in the pack Neath-Swansea Ospreys forward Ryan Jones is preferred at blindside flanker to Jonathan Thomas.""For this particular game, we felt we might not always be afforded the open spaces out wide we were able to exploit against Italy, so an extra big ball-carrier in the back-row is thought to be necessary on this occasion.""

Thomas, a try-scorer in Rome, drops down to the bench instead of Ian Gough, while Cardiff back Rhys Williams steps up in place of Morgan.Kevin Morgan takes over from his injured Newport-Gwent Dragons colleague Hal Luscombe on the right wing."
1623,"Scotland suffered a further blow on the resumption when Ireland flanker Johnny O'Connor won another vital turnover, and O'Gara's basketball pass sent Hickie over in the left corner.If that was a paltry reward for their early pressure, Scotland got the try they deserved when Paterson's searing break and Andy Craig's pass sent Southwell streaking to the right corner.Ireland got themselves on the scoreboard with an O'Gara penalty and by the 24th minute the visitors were ahead.Peter Stringer and O'Kelly combined to put giant prop Hayes over in the right corner before replacement Gavin Duffy scorched away on the left, David Humphreys adding the final flourish with a touchline conversion.

:O'Gara added the conversion and a further penalty, after Shane Horgan almost grabbed a second try from O'Gara's chip to the corner, only for the ball to spill from his hand.Hugo Southwell's try gave the Scots an early 8-0 lead but scores from locks Malcolm O'Kelly and Paul O'Connell put the visitors in command by half-time.The Irish defence foiled the home side on that occasion, but a stray hand in a ruck allowed Paterson to stroke over a penalty in the eighth minute.

Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.

Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory.Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this year's tournament.Tries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage.R de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, W Pozzebon, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni, S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt), A Persico, Mauro Bergamasco, S Parisse.

1625,"""I don't know how much experience a tight-head can give a centre but you are there to give them a pat on the back if things go wrong or to be there if they want to talk in any way,"" he added.White prepared for battle

Tough-scrummaging prop Julian White is expecting a resurgent Wales to give him a rough ride in England's Six Nations opener in Cardiff on Saturday.

""When I first came into the squad, people like Jason Leonard and Martin Johnson were the first to come over and talk through things and help out.

And that is despite the opening game taking place amid the red-hot atmosphere in Cardiff.""It's been a good season so far and to be in the starting XV for the first game of the Six Nations is what every player wants.He has played a bit at tight-headbut I think his favoured position is loose-head and he is very good,"" he added."

England coach Andy Robinson could take a gamble and call inexperienced Sale Sharks prop Andrew Sheridan into his front row.But now that I have this opportunity I intend to take it fully if selected and play my heart out for my country."
1628,"Wales stars need a rest - Ruddock

Wales coach Mike Ruddock has defended his decision not to release any of the international stars for this weekend's regional Celtic League fixtures.

""I'm sure the guys would want to come back to get some game time,"" Forster told BBC Wales Sport.Ruddock says the players will benefit from the rest, and their absence will give youngsters a chance to impress.[Ruddock] as to what they can do.The majority of Ireland and Scotland players have also been released for provincial duty.

The head of Surrey's Lionhead Studios was granted the honour for services to the computer games industry.Mr Molyneux said that his involvement with the games industry started almost by accident as back in the early days game making was more a hobby than a career.He left Bullfrog in 1997 to set up Lionhead Studios which was behind the ambitous and widely acclaimed game Black & White.Mr Molyneux has been a pivotal figure in the computer games industry for almost 20 years."
1924,"On 21 October, the George W Bush website began using the services of a company called Akamai to ensure that the pages, videos and other content on its site reaches visitors.Since then people outside the US trying to browse the site get a message saying they are not authorised to view it.Netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 October attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in London, Amsterdam and Sydney failed.

Mike Prettejohn, president of Netcraft, speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs, and traffic, in the run-up to the election on 2 November.The blocking does not appear to be due to an attack by vandals or malicious hackers, but as a result of a policy decision by the Bush camp.

Computer games could enhance learning and have a legitimate place in the classroom, say researchers.

The second project looked at how games can be integrated into media education and concluded that writing games should be a core part of studying them.The games industry welcomed the report, saying it showed how games had a positive impact on children.""Like all games, computer and video games entertain while promoting social development, and playing and talking about games is an important part of young people's lives,"" said project manager Caroline Pelletier.

Academics from the Institute of Education at London University found that ""games literacy"" was a key skill for youngsters.""But we also want to argue that full understanding only comes when children have the tools to create their own games.""The researchers conducted two studies into the impact of games on education, the first looking at how they can be used in different curriculum subjects to enhance learning."

She said criminals were using the websites to traffic counterfeit credit cards and false identification information and documents such as credit cards, driver's licences, passports and birth certificates.The websites shared tips on how to commit fraud and provided a forum by which people could buy the information and tools they needed to commit such crime, she said.A 19-year-old man from Camberley, Surrey, was arrested by the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit but has been bailed."

Cash machine networks could soon be more susceptible to computer viruses, a security firm has warned.

""Windows cash machines have been around for several years,"" he said.But Mr Hirsch from Retail Banking Research said the number of cash machines actually at risk was low because so few were upgraded every year.

Already there have been four incidents in which Windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the Microsoft operating system.Todd Thiemann, spokesman for anti-virus firm Trend Micro, said the move to Windows in cash machines was not without risks.Risks of infection were small because the data networks that connect UK cash machines together and the operators of the ATMs themselves were a much smaller and tightly-knit community than in the US where viruses have struck.
This often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network."

In each section, the task is simply to wipe out enemy troops, seize strategic waypoints and move on to the next planet.Whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind, Battlefront is actually perfectly good fun as an offline game.The pivotal element behind Battlefront's success is that it successfully gives you the feel of being of being plunged into the midst of large-scale war.And some of the weapons and vehicles are not as responsive and fluid to operate as they might be.It really is no more complicated than that."

Text messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in Asia.

Last week, he sent out e-mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for Asia.

So Mr Senanayake started sending out text messages.""SMS networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call,"" he says.

You have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use.Thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent.

Eidos announced the next CM game, with a new team to develop it from scratch, whilst SI developed the existing code further to be released, with new publishers Sega, under the name Football Manager.But given that Football Manager 2005 is by and large the game that everybody knows and loves, how does this new version shape up?

Musicians are embracing the internet as a way of reaching new fans and selling more music, a survey has found.

""Even successful artists don't think the lawsuits will benefit musicians,"" said report author Mary Madden.

Many suggested that rather than fighting file-sharing, the music industry needed to recognise the changes it has brought and embrace it.""Musicians are embracing the internet enthusiastically,"" said Ms Madden.The study by US researchers, Pew Internet, suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against file-sharing.It found that most artists saw file-sharing as both good and bad, though most agreed that it should be illegal.""

Perhaps surprisingly, opinions about online file-sharing were diverse and not as clear cut as those of the record industry.

The growing popularity of online gaming could spell problems for net service firms, warns network monitoring company Sandvine.

But the surge in numbers and huge demands for bandwidth should be a wake-up call to the industry which must ensure that their networks can cope with the increases in traffic, said Sandvine's chief technology officer Marc Morin.

Service providers now need to make sure that their networks can cope with the increasing demands for bandwidth.""The explosion in Xbox Live traffic attributed to Halo 2 should be seen as a clarion call,"" he said.One of the main factors that spoils online gaming is ""lag"" in which there is a noticeable delay between a gamer clicking on a mouse or keyboard and what happens in the online gaming world.It issued the warning following analysis which shows that traffic on the Xbox game network increased fourfold on the launch day of Halo 2.""In the competitive broadband environment, operators need to differentiate the way they offer access to services like live-play gaming,"" she said."

Samsung of South Korea has a DMB phone too that will be one of those offered to users of the TU Media satellite mobile TV service to be launched in Korea in May.SK Telecom of South Korea, which is launching a TV to mobile service (via satellite) in May plans to charge a flat fee of $12 a month for its 12 channels of video and 12 channels of audio.The jury is still out on whether TV and digital radio on mobiles will make much money for anyone.For those not convinced mobile users will want to watch TV on their handsets, Digital Audio Broadcasting may provide a good compromise and better sound quality than conventional radio."

The Apple Powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time, by US magazine Mobile PC.

The most popular gadget of the moment, the Apple iPod, is at number 12 in the list while the first Sony transistor radio is at number 13.

By far the most useful gadget.The magazine has compiled an all-time top 100 list of gadgets, which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two.However tried it the other day and it was rubbish, still a great gadget of its time.

I'd have put the mobile phone high up the list.You don't need a laptop or even a pocket calculator to work that one out!

Firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all UK phone networks.

The swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones.The rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services.Also, said Mr Flynn, Vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules.""The mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality,"" said Mr Flynn.
Some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for, said Mr Flynn.""People did not know they were being offered a subscription service."""
