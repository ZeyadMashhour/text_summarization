0,"Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed.Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in 
July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form 
a government on its own.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party.``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability 
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised 
speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.Hun 
Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national 
election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government 
on its own.Hun Sen said his current government would remain in 
power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one.Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest 
opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating 
inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence 
in Beijing.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees.The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, 
but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and 
recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. 
Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding 
resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives 
calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian 
law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution 
include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against 
anti-government demonstrations.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation.The ruling party supported the police action 
in its statement, noting that public property was damaged by protesters 
and that grenades were thrown at Hun Sen's home after Sam Rainsy suggested 
in a speech that the U.S. government should fire cruise missiles at 
Hun Sen.``The leaders of illegal demonstrations 
are the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving 
from the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly 
violence as ``minor incidents.''Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government.In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.``The major political 
crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock 
facing the nation has also come to an end,'' the king said in his 
statement.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Monday, Sam 
Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament.Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country.The assurances 
were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun 
Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices 
in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind 
a plot against his life.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied 
to all politicians.``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members 
of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' 
the opposition leader said in a statement.Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties.

against the old government Monday in a letter to ADB President Mitsuo 
Sato calling for the bank to stop lending money to it.``We respectfully 
advise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loans to 
the current regime in Cambodia,'' the two party leaders wrote.After a meeting

Friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun

long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed

64 seats in the 122-member chamber.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The agreement 
came surprisingly quickly following Ranariddh's return Thursday from 
Thailand, where he had been holed up with other opposition figures 
for weeks amid fears for their safety if they stayed in Cambodia. 
The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.It could also hasten Cambodia's entry 
into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, put on hold last 
year after Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody 
coup.Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Monday, Sam 
Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament.Sam Rainsy said he had been told by Ranariddh that 
his party and former Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been implicated by 
Hun Sen in a rocket attack on the Sept. 24 opening of parliament.

of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they

statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election.The alleged assassination attempt came during massive street demonstrations 
organized by the opposition after Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party 
narrowly won the election.Fearing 
for their safety, Sam Rainsy and his then-ally Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
led an exodus of opposition lawmakers out of Cambodia after parliament 
was ceremonially opened in late September.The platform is said to emphasize administrative, economic 
and judicial reforms, but Sok An would not reveal details, saying 
Hun Sen would announce it when he presents his Cabinet choices to 
the National Assembly.

Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national 
election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government 
on its own.Hun Sen said his current government would remain in 
power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
``We respectfully 
advise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loans to 
the current regime in Cambodia,'' the two party leaders wrote.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation.The ruling party also reminded the 
United States that Washington supported a Cambodian exile government 
dominated by the brutal Khmer Rouge in the 1980s.The ruling party accused U.S. policy-makers 
of not taking timely action to save the Cambodian people from the 
Khmer Rouge.Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Cambodia's bickering political parties broke a three-month deadlock 
Friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun 
Sen as sole prime minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced.In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.Instead, Sihanouk announced, 
the constitution will be modified to create a new Senate, which Chea 
Sim will head.The Senate will initially be appointed by the king.The parties will hammer out details later.Pok Than, 
one of Ranariddh's negotiators, said the Senate would serve a mostly 
advisory role to the assembly.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The two parties 
said that the assembly would convene again Nov. 25.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.Former battlefield enemies, the CPP and FUNCINPEC have been 
at loggerheads since the CPP narrowly won parliamentary elections 
in July.The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to form a government alone.His 15 seats in the 122-seat assembly are irrelevant 
to forming a working government. 
 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate.His assurances come a week before the first session 
of Cambodia's new parliament, the National Assembly.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.The deal assures 
the two-thirds vote in parliament needed to approve a new government. 
The men served as co-prime ministers until Hun Sen overthrew Ranariddh 
in a coup last year.Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The 
agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president 
of the National Assembly.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's 
top two political parties _ previously bitter rivals _ to form a coalition 
government led by strongman Hun Sen.``The protocol on cooperation between the CPP and FUNCINPEC will certainly 
bring peace and progress to our nation and people,'' Sihanouk wrote. 
Uncompromising enemies just a few months ago, Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC 
President Prince Norodom Ranariddh agreed Nov. 13 to form a government 
at a summit convened by Sihanouk.The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.The remaining senators, 
he said, should be selected by a method agreed upon by the new government 
and the National Assembly.Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties. 
","Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed.``I would like to make 
it clear that all meetings related to Cambodian affairs must be conducted 
in the Kingdom of Cambodia,'' Hun Sen told reporters after a Cabinet 
meeting on Friday.Hun Sen said 
on Friday that the opposition concerns over their safety in the country 
was ``just an excuse for them to stay abroad.''The Sam Rainsy Party, in a 
statement released Friday, accused Hun Sen of being ``unwilling to 
make any compromise'' on negotiations to break the deadlock.``A meeting 
outside Cambodia, as suggested by the opposition, could place all 
parties on more equal footing,'' said the statement.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.Cambodian leader 
Hun Sen's ruling party and the two-party opposition had called on 
the monarch to lead top-level talks, but disagreed on its location. 
``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party.``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability 
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised 
speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.Hun Sen said his current government would remain in 
power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one.Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest 
opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating 
inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence 
in Beijing.Hun Sen has rejected the opposition's reservations, saying 
it would be inappropriate to hold a summit outside the country.``If those results are strictly respected, there seems no 
reason to hold another summit,'' Hun Sen said in a speech on the anniversary 
of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.``At 
best the current regime could be considered a caretaker government 
as it has not been approved by the National Assembly.''After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees.The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, 
but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and 
recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. 
Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.Ranariddh and his core supporters 
did not return to Cambodia until a few months before an election in 
July this year that the ruling party narrowly won.The ruling party supported the police action 
in its statement, noting that public property was damaged by protesters 
and that grenades were thrown at Hun Sen's home after Sam Rainsy suggested 
in a speech that the U.S. government should fire cruise missiles at 
Hun Sen.Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government.``The major political 
crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock 
facing the nation has also come to an end,'' the king said in his 
statement.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.It could also hasten Cambodia's entry 
into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, put on hold last 
year after Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody 
coup.Earlier, as both sides arrived at the Royal Palace for a second 
day of meetings, Sihanouk said they had agreed in principle to form 
a coalition and made ``important concessions.''After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Monday, Sam 
Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament.Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country.The assurances 
were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun 
Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices 
in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind 
a plot against his life.But a deal 
reached between Hun Sen and his chief rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, 
on forming a new government last week has opened the door for their 
return.``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members 
of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' 
the opposition leader said in a statement.Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government.Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.Hun 
Sen announced a government guarantee Wednesday of all politicians' 
safety and their right to conduct political activities ``in accordance 
with the laws in force.''Sam Rainsy, who earlier called Hun Sen's 
statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election.Sok An, representing 
Hun Sen's party, said Friday that one working group had completed 
its work on a joint political platform to be implemented by the new 
government.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.Sihanouk, recalling 
procedures used in a past government, suggested Tuesday that he should

will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Monday, Sam 
Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament.Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country.The assurances 
were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun 
Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices 
in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind 
a plot against his life.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied 
to all politicians.``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members 
of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' 
the opposition leader said in a statement.Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.Sam Rainsy, who earlier called Hun Sen's 
statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties. 
","Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed.Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in 
July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form 
a government on its own.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party.``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability 
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised 
speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.Hun 
Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national 
election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government 
on its own.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
``We respectfully 
advise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loans to 
the current regime in Cambodia,'' the two party leaders wrote.Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding 
resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives 
calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian 
law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution 
include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against 
anti-government demonstrations.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.It defended Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh 
as a proper response to the prince's attempts at the time to negotiate 
the defections of senior Khmer Rouge rebels.The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation.``The leaders of illegal demonstrations 
are the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving 
from the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly 
violence as ``minor incidents.''The ruling party also reminded the 
United States that Washington supported a Cambodian exile government 
dominated by the brutal Khmer Rouge in the 1980s.Cambodia's leading opposition party ruled out sharing the presidency 
of Parliament with its arch foe Saturday, insisting it alone must 
occupy the top position in the legislative body.Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government.In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.``The major political 
crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock 
facing the nation has also come to an end,'' the king said in his 
statement.Pok Than, 
one of Ranariddh's negotiators, said the Senate would serve a mostly 
advisory role to the assembly.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to form a government alone.His 15 seats in the 122-seat assembly are irrelevant 
to forming a working government. 
 
Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate.Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to

had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties.

opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating 
inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence 
in Beijing.At least four demonstrators were killed by police, 
but the discovery of more than 20 bodies in the aftermath has prompted 
speculation that the death tally could be much higher.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy renewed their international lobbying campaign 
against the old government Monday in a letter to ADB President Mitsuo 
Sato calling for the bank to stop lending money to it.``We respectfully 
advise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loans to 
the current regime in Cambodia,'' the two party leaders wrote.After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees.``There have been 
reports that there is an attempt to internationalize the return of 
those members of parliament on the excuse of security problems,'' 
Prak Sokhonn said.The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country,

After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Monday, Sam 
Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament.Sam Rainsy said he had been told by Ranariddh that 
his party and former Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been implicated by 
Hun Sen in a rocket attack on the Sept. 24 opening of parliament.

of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country.The assurances

statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment

The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties. 
","Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed.Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in 
July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form 
a government on its own.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party.``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability 
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised 
speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.Hun 
Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national 
election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government 
on its own.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding 
resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives 
calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian 
law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution 
include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against 
anti-government demonstrations.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation.``The leaders of illegal demonstrations 
are the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving 
from the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly 
violence as ``minor incidents.''The ruling party also reminded the 
United States that Washington supported a Cambodian exile government 
dominated by the brutal Khmer Rouge in the 1980s.Cambodia's leading opposition party ruled out sharing the presidency 
of Parliament with its arch foe Saturday, insisting it alone must 
occupy the top position in the legislative body.Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government.Cambodia's bickering political parties broke a three-month deadlock 
Friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun 
Sen as sole prime minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced.In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.It could also hasten Cambodia's entry 
into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, put on hold last 
year after Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody 
coup.The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to form a government alone.Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.The deal assures 
the two-thirds vote in parliament needed to approve a new government. 
Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.The alleged assassination attempt came during massive street demonstrations 
organized by the opposition after Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party 
narrowly won the election.Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The 
agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president 
of the National Assembly.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.The platform is said to emphasize administrative, economic 
and judicial reforms, but Sok An would not reveal details, saying 
Hun Sen would announce it when he presents his Cabinet choices to 
the National Assembly. 
 
King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's 
top two political parties _ previously bitter rivals _ to form a coalition 
government led by strongman Hun Sen.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
Uncompromising enemies just a few months ago, Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC 
President Prince Norodom Ranariddh agreed Nov. 13 to form a government 
at a summit convened by Sihanouk.The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President

figures after two alleged attempts on his life, said they could not 
negotiate freely in Cambodia and called for talks at Sihanouk's residence 
in Beijing.``I would like to make 
it clear that all meetings related to Cambodian affairs must be conducted 
in the Kingdom of Cambodia,'' Hun Sen told reporters after a Cabinet 
meeting on Friday.They have demanded a thorough investigation into their election 
complaints as a precondition for their cooperation in getting the 
national assembly moving and a new government formed.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's

minister Sam Ram Rainsy have refused to enter into a coalition with 
Hun Sen until their allegations of election fraud have been thoroughly 
investigated.Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest 
opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating 
inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence 
in Beijing.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy

Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy renewed their international lobbying campaign 
against the old government Monday in a letter to ADB President Mitsuo 
Sato calling for the bank to stop lending money to it.After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees.The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, 
but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and 
recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. 
Diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled talks appeared to bear fruit 
Monday as Japanese Foreign Affairs Secretary of State Nobutaka Machimura 
said King Norodom Sihanouk has called on Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
to return to Cambodia.Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is

came surprisingly quickly following Ranariddh's return Thursday from 
Thailand, where he had been holed up with other opposition figures 
for weeks amid fears for their safety if they stayed in Cambodia. 
The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which

Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament.Sam Rainsy said he had been told by Ranariddh that 
his party and former Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been implicated by 
Hun Sen in a rocket attack on the Sept. 24 opening of parliament. 
Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country.The assurances 
were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun 
Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices 
in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind 
a plot against his life.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied 
to all politicians.Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government.Last week, Hun Sen's

statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election.Fearing 
for their safety, Sam Rainsy and his then-ally Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
led an exodus of opposition lawmakers out of Cambodia after parliament 
was ceremonially opened in late September.The platform is said to emphasize administrative, economic

``We respectfully 
advise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loans to 
the current regime in Cambodia,'' the two party leaders wrote.``At 
best the current regime could be considered a caretaker government 
as it has not been approved by the National Assembly.''``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation.The ruling party also reminded the 
United States that Washington supported a Cambodian exile government 
dominated by the brutal Khmer Rouge in the 1980s.Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Cambodia's bickering political parties broke a three-month deadlock 
Friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun 
Sen as sole prime minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced.In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.Instead, Sihanouk announced, 
the constitution will be modified to create a new Senate, which Chea 
Sim will head.The Senate will initially be appointed by the king.The parties will hammer out details later.Pok Than, 
one of Ranariddh's negotiators, said the Senate would serve a mostly 
advisory role to the assembly.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The two parties 
said that the assembly would convene again Nov. 25.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to form a government alone.His 15 seats in the 122-seat assembly are irrelevant 
to forming a working government. 
 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.Ranariddh said Saturday 
that the two parties agreed to keep the ministries of interior and 
defense under co-ministers.The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate.His assurances come a week before the first session 
of Cambodia's new parliament, the National Assembly.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.The deal assures 
the two-thirds vote in parliament needed to approve a new government. 
The men served as co-prime ministers until Hun Sen overthrew Ranariddh 
in a coup last year.Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The 
agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president 
of the National Assembly.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's 
top two political parties _ previously bitter rivals _ to form a coalition 
government led by strongman Hun Sen.``The protocol on cooperation between the CPP and FUNCINPEC will certainly 
bring peace and progress to our nation and people,'' Sihanouk wrote. 
The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.The remaining senators, 
he said, should be selected by a method agreed upon by the new government 
and the National Assembly.Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties. 
","Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed.Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in 
July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form 
a government on its own.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.Cambodian leader 
Hun Sen's ruling party and the two-party opposition had called on 
the monarch to lead top-level talks, but disagreed on its location. 
``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party.Hun 
Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national 
election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government 
on its own.Hun Sen said his current government would remain in 
power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying

Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate.Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties. 
","Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed.Opposition leaders Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition 
figures after two alleged attempts on his life, said they could not 
negotiate freely in Cambodia and called for talks at Sihanouk's residence 
in Beijing.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party.``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability 
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised 
speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest 
opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating 
inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence 
in Beijing.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy renewed their international lobbying campaign 
against the old government Monday in a letter to ADB President Mitsuo 
Sato calling for the bank to stop lending money to it.After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees.The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, 
but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and 
recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. 
Diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled talks appeared to bear fruit 
Monday as Japanese Foreign Affairs Secretary of State Nobutaka Machimura 
said King Norodom Sihanouk has called on Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
to return to Cambodia.Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding 
resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives 
calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian 
law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution 
include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against 
anti-government demonstrations.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.It defended Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh 
as a proper response to the prince's attempts at the time to negotiate 
the defections of senior Khmer Rouge rebels.The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation.The ruling party supported the police action 
in its statement, noting that public property was damaged by protesters 
and that grenades were thrown at Hun Sen's home after Sam Rainsy suggested 
in a speech that the U.S. government should fire cruise missiles at 
Hun Sen.``The leaders of illegal demonstrations 
are the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving 
from the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly 
violence as ``minor incidents.''Cambodia's leading opposition party ruled out sharing the presidency 
of Parliament with its arch foe Saturday, insisting it alone must 
occupy the top position in the legislative body.Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government.In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.``The major political 
crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock 
facing the nation has also come to an end,'' the king said in his 
statement.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk released Monday, Sam 
Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament.Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country.The assurances 
were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun 
Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices 
in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind 
a plot against his life.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied 
to all politicians.``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members 
of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' 
the opposition leader said in a statement.Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government.Last week, Hun Sen's

that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns

statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements

negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed.Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in 
July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form 
a government on its own.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party.``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability 
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised 
speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.Hun 
Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national 
election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government 
on its own.Hun Sen said his current government would remain in 
power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees.The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, 
but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and 
recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. 
Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding 
resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives 
calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian 
law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution 
include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against 
anti-government demonstrations.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.It defended Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh 
as a proper response to the prince's attempts at the time to negotiate 
the defections of senior Khmer Rouge rebels.The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation.``The leaders of illegal demonstrations 
are the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving 
from the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly 
violence as ``minor incidents.''Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government.In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.``The major political 
crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock 
facing the nation has also come to an end,'' the king said in his 
statement.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to form a government alone.Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied 
to all politicians.``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members 
of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' 
the opposition leader said in a statement.Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The 
agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president 
of the National Assembly.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.The remaining senators, 
he said, should be selected by a method agreed upon by the new government 
and the National Assembly.Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties.

security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament.Sam Rainsy said he had been told by Ranariddh that 
his party and former Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been implicated by 
Hun Sen in a rocket attack on the Sept. 24 opening of parliament. 
Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country.The assurances 
were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun 
Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices 
in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind 
a plot against his life.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father

free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election.The two parties have formed three working

to form a government alone.Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership

Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and

organized by the opposition after Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party 
narrowly won the election.Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The 
agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president 
of the National Assembly.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.The platform is said to emphasize administrative, economic 
and judicial reforms, but Sok An would not reveal details, saying 
Hun Sen would announce it when he presents his Cabinet choices to 
the National Assembly. 
 
King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's 
top two political parties _ previously bitter rivals _ to form a coalition 
government led by strongman Hun Sen.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
Uncompromising enemies just a few months ago, Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC 
President Prince Norodom Ranariddh agreed Nov. 13 to form a government 
at a summit convened by Sihanouk.The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President

After a meeting

the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international

include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against 
anti-government demonstrations.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation.The ruling party supported the police action 
in its statement, noting that public property was damaged by protesters 
and that grenades were thrown at Hun Sen's home after Sam Rainsy suggested 
in a speech that the U.S. government should fire cruise missiles at 
Hun Sen.``The leaders of illegal demonstrations 
are the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving 
from the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly 
violence as ``minor incidents.''Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government.Cambodia's bickering political parties broke a three-month deadlock 
Friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun 
Sen as sole prime minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced.In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.``The major political 
crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock 
facing the nation has also come to an end,'' the king said in his 
statement.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied 
to all politicians.``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members 
of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' 
the opposition leader said in a statement.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The 
agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president 
of the National Assembly.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's 
top two political parties _ previously bitter rivals _ to form a coalition 
government led by strongman Hun Sen.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties. 
","Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed.Opposition leaders Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition 
figures after two alleged attempts on his life, said they could not 
negotiate freely in Cambodia and called for talks at Sihanouk's residence 
in Beijing.Hun Sen said 
on Friday that the opposition concerns over their safety in the country 
was ``just an excuse for them to stay abroad.''The Sam Rainsy Party, in a 
statement released Friday, accused Hun Sen of being ``unwilling to 
make any compromise'' on negotiations to break the deadlock.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Opposition parties led by Ranariddh and former finance 
minister Sam Ram Rainsy have refused to enter into a coalition with 
Hun Sen until their allegations of election fraud have been thoroughly 
investigated.Hun Sen said his current government would remain in 
power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one.Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest 
opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating 
inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence 
in Beijing.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees.The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, 
but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and 
recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. 
Diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled talks appeared to bear fruit 
Monday as Japanese Foreign Affairs Secretary of State Nobutaka Machimura 
said King Norodom Sihanouk has called on Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
to return to Cambodia.Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding 
resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives 
calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian

Rainsy complained that Hun Sen had not responded to his queries on 
security, making it unsafe for his people to return for the reconvening 
of parliament.Sam Rainsy said he had been told by Ranariddh that 
his party and former Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been implicated by 
Hun Sen in a rocket attack on the Sept. 24 opening of parliament. 
Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom 
of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they 
will be arrested or killed if they return to the country.The assurances 
were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun 
Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices 
in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind 
a plot against his life.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied

statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for his help in obtaining 
a promise from Hun Sen that all members of the Sam Rainsy Party were 
free from prosecution for their political activities during and after 
last July's election.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment

statement.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate.In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father 
and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, 
Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied 
to all politicians.``It should be easy for them to say, `Rainsy and the SRP members 
of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,''' 
the opposition leader said in a statement.Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The 
agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president 
of the National Assembly.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties. 
","Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed.Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in 
July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form 
a government on its own.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party.``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability 
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised 
speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.Hun 
Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national 
election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government 
on its own.Hun Sen said his current government would remain in 
power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one.Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest 
opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, 
Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating 
inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence 
in Beijing.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees.The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, 
but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and 
recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. 
Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding 
resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives 
calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian 
law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution 
include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against 
anti-government demonstrations.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.It defended Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh 
as a proper response to the prince's attempts at the time to negotiate 
the defections of senior Khmer Rouge rebels.The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation.``The leaders of illegal demonstrations 
are the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving 
from the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly 
violence as ``minor incidents.''Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government.In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.``The major political 
crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock

form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, 
opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of 
security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote 
in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the 
first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained 
that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns 
his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC 
party finished a close second in the election, returned last week 
and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government.The two parties have formed three working 
groups to hammer out details of the agreement, including the establishment 
of a Senate to be the upper house of parliament.In a short letter sent to news 
agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements 
signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party 
in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government. 
The deal, which will make Hun Sen 
prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended 
more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July 
election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation 
of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President 
Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC 
had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat 
National Assembly.Other details of the Senate, including how much 
power it will be given in the promulgation of legislation, have yet 
to be ironed out by the two parties. 
","Government and opposition parties have asked 
King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election 
negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party 
to form a new government failed.Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in 
July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form 
a government on its own.King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's 
top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress 
in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three 
parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such 
a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the 
senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises 
to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to 
take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Hun Sen used 
Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil 
war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with 
his party.``Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability 
prevent efforts to set up a new government,'' Hun Sen said in a televised 
speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords.Hun 
Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national 
election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government 
on its own.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, 
and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy 
are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman 
Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying 
to make its members' return an international issue.Hun Sen's ruling 
party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition 
_ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen 
the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. 
``We respectfully 
advise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loans to 
the current regime in Cambodia,'' the two party leaders wrote.After a meeting 
between Hun Sen and the new French ambassador to Cambodia, Hun Sen 
aide Prak Sokhonn said the Cambodian leader had repeated calls for 
the opposition to return, but expressed concern that the international 
community may be asked for security guarantees.The opposition has insisted that any 
further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, 
but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and 
recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country. 
Less than two weeks after abandoning hope that 
he could influence the parties to reach a compromise, Sihanouk is 
now ``strongly interested'' in presiding over a summit meeting of 
the three party leaders in Cambodia, Machimura said. 
 
The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding 
resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives 
calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian 
law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution 
include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against 
anti-government demonstrations.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely 
and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice 
to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian people by not approving it,'' 
the party said in a statement.It defended Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh 
as a proper response to the prince's attempts at the time to negotiate 
the defections of senior Khmer Rouge rebels.The killings of nearly 100 of 
Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in 
the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications 
meant to distort the political situation.The ruling party supported the police action 
in its statement, noting that public property was damaged by protesters 
and that grenades were thrown at Hun Sen's home after Sam Rainsy suggested 
in a speech that the U.S. government should fire cruise missiles at 
Hun Sen.``The leaders of illegal demonstrations 
are the ones who must bear responsibility for the consequences deriving 
from the protest,'' the CPP said Tuesday, referring to the deadly 
violence as ``minor incidents.''The ruling party also reminded the 
United States that Washington supported a Cambodian exile government 
dominated by the brutal Khmer Rouge in the 1980s.Cambodia's leading opposition party ruled out sharing the presidency 
of Parliament with its arch foe Saturday, insisting it alone must 
occupy the top position in the legislative body.Disputes over the 
presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the 
two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form 
a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has 
offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC 
party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.``No party with 
seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency 
and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the 
statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party should also be given 
chairmanship of one of the national assembly's nine commissions.Noting 
that FUNCINPEC allowed the CPP to hold the presidency despite its 
win in the 1993 general elections, the statement said it was now its 
turn to take the post.In the most recent elections, held in July, 
Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was 
short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. 
Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh 
to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make 
an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a 
government.In a 
long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed 
elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 
64 seats in the 122-member chamber.``The major political 
crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock 
facing the nation has also come to an end,'' the king said in his 
statement.The senior Senate leaders will join 
those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two 
Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that 
will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between the 
CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international donors 
and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken country, which 
is in desperate need of aid.The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to form a government alone.Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership 
between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. 
Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 
1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over 
power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling 
Khmer Rouge.Hun Sen's Cambodian People's 
Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by 
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election 
negotiations.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to 
a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh 
president of the National Assembly.The parties are to form working groups this week 
to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment 
to form a new Senate.Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, 
the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning 
of ministries in the new coalition government.Last week, Hun Sen's 
Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to 
form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and 
make the prince president of the National Assembly.Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics,

Honduras braced for potential catastrophe Tuesday as Hurricane Mitch 
roared through the northwest Caribbean, churning up high waves and 
intense rain that sent coastal residents scurrying for safer ground. 
President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of maximum alert 
and the Honduran military sent planes to pluck residents from their 
homes on islands near the coast.Mitch posed no immediate threat to the United States, forecasters 
said, but was expected to remain in the northwest Caribbean for five 
days.The Honduran 
president closed schools and public offices on the coast Monday and 
ordered all air force planes and helicopters to evacuate people from 
the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the country's 
central coast.The head of the Honduran armed forces, Gen. Mario Hung 
Pacheco, said 5,000 soldiers were standing by to help victims of the 
storm, but he warned the military could not reach everyone.Mexico mobilized troops and 
emergency workers Monday on the east coast of the Yucatan peninsula, 
which was also under a hurricane watch, and Cuba said it had evacuated 
600 vacationers from the Island of Youth.Jerry Jarrell, the weather 
center director, said Mitch was the strongest hurricane to strike 
the Caribbean since 1988, when Gilbert killed more than 300 people. 
``If 
it gets really bad, we'll go to the church and see what the architect 
of the world has in store for us.''In El Progreso, 
100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, 
the army evacuated more than 5,000 people who live in low-lying banana 
plantations along the Ulua River, said Nolly Soliman, a resident. 
Rain squalls flooded streets in the Jamaican capital, 
Kingston, and government offices and schools closed in the Caymans, 
a British colony of 28,000 people.Hurricane Mitch paused in its whirl through the western Caribbean 
on Wednesday to punish Honduras with 120-mph (205-kph) winds, topping 
trees, sweeping away bridges, flooding neighborhoods and killing at 
least 32 people.That meant the Honduran coast had been under hurricane 
conditions for more than a day.``The hurricane has destroyed almost 
everything,'' said Mike Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island which 
was within miles (kms) of the eye of the hurricane.The storm's power was easing and by 1200 GMT, 
it had sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph), down from 100 mph (160 
kph) around midnight and well below its 180 mph (290 kph) peak of 
early Tuesday.After remaining virtually stationary for more than 
a day, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Thursday the center 
of the 350-mile-wide (560-kilometer-wide) storm had moved slightly 
to the south but remained just off the Honduran coast.Caught 
near the heart of the storm were the Bay Islands, about 25 miles (40 
kilometers) off Honduras' coast and popular with divers and beachcombers. 
``The hurricane has destroyed almost everything,'' said Mike Brown, 
a resident of Guanaja Island, 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the coast. 
Honduran officials said 14 
people had died on that small island alone, and at least nine had 
died elsewhere in the country.With the storm seemingly 
anchored off Honduras, officials in Mexico to the north eased emergency 
measures on the Caribbean coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, where hundreds 
of people remained in shelters as a precaution Wednesday night.At its peak, Mitch was the fourth-strongest Caribbean hurricane in 
this century, behind Gilbert in 1988, Allen in 1980 and the Labor 
Day hurricane of 1935. 
 
At least 231 people have been confirmed dead in Honduras from former-hurricane 
Mitch, bringing the storm's death toll in the region to 357, the National 
Emergency Commission said Saturday.In the Caribbean, 
the U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a tourist schooner with 
31 people aboard that hasn't been heard from since Tuesday.By late 
Sunday, Mitch's winds, once near 180 mph (290 kph), had dropped to 
near 30 mph (50 kph), and the storm _ now classified as a tropical 
depression _ was near Tapachula, on Mexico's southern Pacific coast 
near the Guatemalan border.Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said Sunday night that between 
1,000 and 1,500 people were buried in a 32-square mile (82.88 square-kilometer) 
area below the slopes of the Casita volcano in northern Nicaragua. 
EU spokesman Pietro Petrucci said the funds will be used 
to provide basic care such as medicine, food, water sanitation and 
blankets to thousands of people whose homes were destroyed by torrential 
rains and mudslides.The aid will be distributed in Nicaragua, El 
Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala which have most suffered from Mitch's 
deadly passage, the EU executive Commission said in a statement.The greatest losses were reported in Honduras, 
where an estimated 5,000 people died and 600,000 people _ 10 percent 
of the population _ were forced to flee their homes after last week's 
storm.Pope John Paul II appealed for aid Wednesday for the Central American 
countries stricken by hurricane Mitch and said he feels close to the 
thousands who are suffering.Speaking during his general audience, 
the pope urged ``all public and private institutions and all men of 
good will'' to do all they can ``in this grave moment of destruction 
and death.''Better information from Honduras' ravaged countryside enabled officials 
to lower the confirmed death toll from Hurricane Mitch from 7,000 
to about 6,100 on Thursday, but leaders insisted the need for help 
was growing.He urged the more than 
1.5 million Hondurans affected by the storm to help with the recovery 
effort.``The county is semi-destroyed and awaits the maximum effort 
and most fervent and constant work of every one of its children,'' 
he said.In Washington on Thursday, President Bill

due to Hurricane Georges, which struck the Caribbean in October.the 
departments of Cortes, Atlantida, Colon and Yoro in the north, southern 
Choluteca and Valle, and the central department of Francisco Morazan, 
which includes the capital.In the flood-ravaged Tegucigalpa neighborhood 
of Nueva Esperanza, Mexican military rescuers loaded search dogs on 
their backs and forded a muddy river to look for people believed buried 
in a 200-foot (60-meter) avalanche that occurred last Friday.Doctors volunteering at a shelter 
housing 4,000 people at Tegucigalpa's Polytechnic Development Institute 
said they'd heard of the campaign but had yet to receive word or medicines 
from the Health Ministry.``We have to vaccinate the children,'' said 
Dr. Mario Soto, who has treated at least 300 children at the shelter 
for diarrhea, conjunctivitis and bacterial infections. 
 
Aid workers struggled Friday to reach survivors of Hurricane Mitch, 
who are in danger of dying from starvation and disease in the wake 
of the storm that officials estimate killed more than 10,000 people. 
Foreign aid and pledges of assistance poured into Central America, 
but damage to roads and bridges reduced the amount of supplies reaching 
hundreds of isolated communities to a trickle: only as much as could 
be dropped from a helicopter, when the aircraft can get through.A score of cargo aircraft landed Thursday at the normally 
quiet Toncontin airport in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, delivering 
aid from Mexico, the United States, Japan and Argentina.Two British ships that were in the area on 
an exercise were on their way to Honduras to join relief efforts, 
the Defense Ministry said Friday.","President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of maximum alert

of the population _ were forced to flee their homes after last week's 
storm.Pope John Paul II appealed for aid Wednesday for the Central American 
countries stricken by hurricane Mitch and said he feels close to the 
thousands who are suffering.Speaking during his general audience, 
the pope urged ``all public and private institutions and all men of

to lower the confirmed death toll from Hurricane Mitch from 7,000 
to about 6,100 on Thursday, but leaders insisted the need for help 
was growing.In Washington on Thursday, President Bill 
Clinton ordered dlrs 30 million in Defense Department equipment and 
services and dlrs 36 million in food, fuel and other aid be sent to 
Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.The White House also

Aid workers struggled Friday to reach survivors of Hurricane Mitch, 
who are in danger of dying from starvation and disease in the wake 
of the storm that officials estimate killed more than 10,000 people. 
Foreign aid and pledges of assistance poured into Central America, 
but damage to roads and bridges reduced the amount of supplies reaching 
hundreds of isolated communities to a trickle: only as much as could 
be dropped from a helicopter, when the aircraft can get through.A score of cargo aircraft landed Thursday at the normally 
quiet Toncontin airport in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, delivering 
aid from Mexico, the United States, Japan and Argentina.Former U.S.

next week led by Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, to deliver 
some of the supplies destined for Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador 
and Guatemala.Nicaragua said Friday it will accept Cuba's offer to send doctors 
as long as the communist nation flies them in on its own helicopters 
and with their own supplies.Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistas, 
who maintained close relations with Fidel Castro during their 1979-90 
rule, had criticized the refusal by President Arnoldo Aleman's administration. 
","President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of maximum alert 
and the Honduran military sent planes to pluck residents from their 
homes on islands near the coast.At 0900 GMT Tuesday, Mitch was 95 
miles (152 kilometers) north of Honduras, near the Swan Islands.With 
winds near 180 mph (289 kph), and even higher gusts, it was a Category 
5 monster _ the highest, most dangerous rating for a storm.The 350-mile 
(560-kilometer) wide hurricane was moving west at 8 mph (12 kph). 
``Mitch is closing in,'' said Monterrey Cardenas, mayor of Utila, 
an island 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the Honduran coast.The Honduran 
president closed schools and public offices on the coast Monday and 
ordered all air force planes and helicopters to evacuate people from 
the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the country's 
central coast.The head of the Honduran armed forces, Gen. Mario Hung 
Pacheco, said 5,000 soldiers were standing by to help victims of the 
storm, but he warned the military could not reach everyone.``For 
that humanitarian work, we would need more than 300 Hercules C-137 
planes,'' he said.Mexico mobilized troops and 
emergency workers Monday on the east coast of the Yucatan peninsula, 
which was also under a hurricane watch, and Cuba said it had evacuated 
600 vacationers from the Island of Youth.Jerry Jarrell, the weather 
center director, said Mitch was the strongest hurricane to strike 
the Caribbean since 1988, when Gilbert killed more than 300 people. 
In El Progreso, 
100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, 
the army evacuated more than 5,000 people who live in low-lying banana 
plantations along the Ulua River, said Nolly Soliman, a resident. 
Hurricane Mitch paused in its whirl through the western Caribbean 
on Wednesday to punish Honduras with 120-mph (205-kph) winds, topping 
trees, sweeping away bridges, flooding neighborhoods and killing at 
least 32 people.Mitch was drifting west at only 2 mph (3 kph) over 
the Bay Islands, Honduras' most popular tourist area.It also was 
only 30 miles (50 kms) off the coast, and hurricane-force winds stretched 
outward 105 miles (165 kms); tropical storm-force winds 175 miles 
(280 kms).That meant the Honduran coast had been under hurricane 
conditions for more than a day.``The hurricane has destroyed almost 
everything,'' said Mike Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island which 
was within miles (kms) of the eye of the hurricane.``Few houses have

Hurricane Mitch cut through the Honduran coast like a ripsaw Thursday, 
its devastating winds whirling for a third day through resort islands 
and mainland communities.The storm's power was easing and by 1200 GMT, 
it had sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph), down from 100 mph (160 
kph) around midnight and well below its 180 mph (290 kph) peak of 
early Tuesday.After remaining virtually stationary for more than 
a day, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Thursday the center 
of the 350-mile-wide (560-kilometer-wide) storm had moved slightly 
to the south but remained just off the Honduran coast.Hurricane-force 
winds whirled up to 30 miles (50 kilometers) from the center, with 
rain-laden tropical storm winds extending well beyond that.Caught 
near the heart of the storm were the Bay Islands, about 25 miles (40 
kilometers) off Honduras' coast and popular with divers and beachcombers. 
``The hurricane has destroyed almost everything,'' said Mike Brown, 
a resident of Guanaja Island, 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the coast. 
``Few houses have remained standing.''more than a day after Mitch drifted to

said more than 200 towns and villages had been isolated by the storm, 
left without power, telephones or clean drinking water.Rain-swollen rivers knocked out bridges and roads, isolating La Ceiba, 
a coastal city of 40,000 people located 80 miles (128 kilometers) 
from the Bay Islands.Wind-whipped waves almost buried some 
houses near the shore.The cable television company 
was broadcasting only The Weather Channel.More 
than 20,000 tourists had abandoned Cancun and nearby resort areas, 
leaving hotels at about 20 percent of capacity.In the Caribbean, 
the U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a tourist schooner with 
31 people aboard that hasn't been heard from since Tuesday.By late 
Sunday, Mitch's winds, once near 180 mph (290 kph), had dropped to 
near 30 mph (50 kph), and the storm _ now classified as a tropical 
depression _ was near Tapachula, on Mexico's southern Pacific coast 
near the Guatemalan border.Mitch was moving west at 8 mph (13 kph) 
and was dissipating but threatened to strengthen again if it moved 
back out to sea. 
 
He urged the more than 
1.5 million Hondurans affected by the storm to help with the recovery 
effort.``We have more access to places affected by the storm,'' Urbizo explained. 
Mitch, 
which sat off the Honduran coast for several days last week, destroyed 
scores of Central American communities before moving northwest.Countries 
overwhelmed by the storm's devastation have only just begun to calculate 
the damage.Honduran authorities still don't know how many shelters 
have been set up across the Central American country.``Our problem is that 
all of the country has been affected,'' he said.Dozens 
of homes were swept into the river.``This is the first place we've 
been'' with the dogs, Honduran army Maj. Freddy Diaz Celaya said. 
``The 
worst thing, the saddest thing, are the children.","Mitch posed no immediate threat to the United States, forecasters 
said, but was expected to remain in the northwest Caribbean for five 
days.The entire coast 
of Honduras was under a hurricane warning and up to 15 inches (38 
centimeters) of rain was forecast in mountain areas.The Honduran 
president closed schools and public offices on the coast Monday and 
ordered all air force planes and helicopters to evacuate people from 
the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the country's

600 vacationers from the Island of Youth.Jerry Jarrell, the weather 
center director, said Mitch was the strongest hurricane to strike 
the Caribbean since 1988, when Gilbert killed more than 300 people. 
``Frightened people are moving 
into the mountains to search for shelter,'' he said.The strongest hurricane to hit 
Honduras in recent memory was Fifi in 1974, which ravaged Honduras' 
Caribbean coast, killing at least 2,000 people. 
 
That meant the Honduran coast had been under hurricane 
conditions for more than a day.Mitch, 
once among the century's most powerful hurricanes, weakened today 
as it blasted this Central American nation, bringing downpours that 
flooded at least 50 rivers.After remaining virtually stationary for more than 
a day, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Thursday the center 
of the 350-mile-wide (560-kilometer-wide) storm had moved slightly 
to the south but remained just off the Honduran coast.Honduran officials said 14 
people had died on that small island alone, and at least nine had 
died elsewhere in the country.Nine other deaths had been reported elsewhere in the 
region by early Thursday _more than a day after Mitch drifted to 
just off the coast and seemed to park thereAn American was thrown 
from his boat south of Cancun, Mexico, on Monday and was presumed 
dead.Honduran officials 
said more than 200 towns and villages had been isolated by the storm, 
left without power, telephones or clean drinking water.With the storm seemingly 
anchored off Honduras, officials in Mexico to the north eased emergency 
measures on the Caribbean coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, where hundreds 
of people remained in shelters as a precaution Wednesday night.At least 231 people have been confirmed dead in Honduras from former-hurricane 
Mitch, bringing the storm's death toll in the region to 357, the National 
Emergency Commission said Saturday.El Salvador _ where 140 people 
died in flash floods _ declared a state of emergency Saturday, as 
did Guatemala, where 21 people died when floods swept away their homes. 
In the Caribbean, 
the U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a tourist schooner with 
31 people aboard that hasn't been heard from since Tuesday.That is in addition to least another 600 people elsewhere in the country,

Hurricane Mitch cut through the Honduran coast like a ripsaw Thursday, 
its devastating winds whirling for a third day through resort islands 
and mainland communities.Mitch, 
once among the century's most powerful hurricanes, weakened today 
as it blasted this Central American nation, bringing downpours that 
flooded at least 50 rivers.The storm's power was easing and by 1200 GMT, 
it had sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph), down from 100 mph (160 
kph) around midnight and well below its 180 mph (290 kph) peak of 
early Tuesday.After remaining virtually stationary for more than 
a day, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Thursday the center 
of the 350-mile-wide (560-kilometer-wide) storm had moved slightly 
to the south but remained just off the Honduran coast.While supplies of food and gasoline 
seemed to hold up, drivers worried about the coming days formed long 
lines to fill their tanks at gas stations and some supermarkets took 
measures to limit panic buying.With the storm seemingly 
anchored off Honduras, officials in Mexico to the north eased emergency 
measures on the Caribbean coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, where hundreds 
of people remained in shelters as a precaution Wednesday night.At least 231 people have been confirmed dead in Honduras from former-hurricane 
Mitch, bringing the storm's death toll in the region to 357, the National 
Emergency Commission said Saturday.El Salvador _ where 140 people 
died in flash floods _ declared a state of emergency Saturday, as 
did Guatemala, where 21 people died when floods swept away their homes. 
By late 
Sunday, Mitch's winds, once near 180 mph (290 kph), had dropped to 
near 30 mph (50 kph), and the storm _ now classified as a tropical 
depression _ was near Tapachula, on Mexico's southern Pacific coast 
near the Guatemalan border.Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said Sunday night that between 
1,000 and 1,500 people were buried in a 32-square mile (82.88 square-kilometer)

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Tuesday approved 6.4 
million European currency units (dlrs 7.7 million) in aid for thousands 
of victims of the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch in Central 
America.EU spokesman Pietro Petrucci said the funds will be used 
to provide basic care such as medicine, food, water sanitation and 
blankets to thousands of people whose homes were destroyed by torrential 
rains and mudslides.The aid will be distributed in Nicaragua, El 
Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala which have most suffered from Mitch's 
deadly passage, the EU executive Commission said in a statement.The greatest losses were reported in Honduras, 
where an estimated 5,000 people died and 600,000 people _ 10 percent 
of the population _ were forced to flee their homes after last week's 
storm.Pope John Paul II appealed for aid Wednesday for the Central American 
countries stricken by hurricane Mitch and said he feels close to the 
thousands who are suffering.Speaking during his general audience, 
the pope urged ``all public and private institutions and all men of 
good will'' to do all they can ``in this grave moment of destruction 
and death.''Hurricane Mitch killed an estimated 9,000 people throughout 
Central America in a disaster of such proportions that relief agencies 
have been overwhelmed.Better information from Honduras' ravaged countryside enabled officials 
to lower the confirmed death toll from Hurricane Mitch from 7,000 
to about 6,100 on Thursday, but leaders insisted the need for help 
was growing.In Washington on Thursday, President Bill 
Clinton ordered dlrs 30 million in Defense Department equipment and

shelter conditions could produce outbreaks of hepatitis, respiratory 
infections and other ailments, the Health Ministry announced an inoculation 
campaign, especially for children.Doctors volunteering at a shelter

of the storm that officials estimate killed more than 10,000 people. 
Foreign aid and pledges of assistance poured into Central America, 
but damage to roads and bridges reduced the amount of supplies reaching 
hundreds of isolated communities to a trickle: only as much as could 
be dropped from a helicopter, when the aircraft can get through.A score of cargo aircraft landed Thursday at the normally 
quiet Toncontin airport in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, delivering 
aid from Mexico, the United States, Japan and Argentina.Former U.S.

Honduras braced for potential catastrophe Tuesday as Hurricane Mitch 
roared through the northwest Caribbean, churning up high waves and 
intense rain that sent coastal residents scurrying for safer ground. 
President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of maximum alert 
and the Honduran military sent planes to pluck residents from their 
homes on islands near the coast.The Honduran 
president closed schools and public offices on the coast Monday and 
ordered all air force planes and helicopters to evacuate people from 
the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the country's 
central coast.The head of the Honduran armed forces, Gen. Mario Hung 
Pacheco, said 5,000 soldiers were standing by to help victims of the 
storm, but he warned the military could not reach everyone.Mexico mobilized troops and 
emergency workers Monday on the east coast of the Yucatan peninsula, 
which was also under a hurricane watch, and Cuba said it had evacuated 
600 vacationers from the Island of Youth.Jerry Jarrell, the weather

the army evacuated more than 5,000 people who live in low-lying banana 
plantations along the Ulua River, said Nolly Soliman, a resident. 
Rain squalls flooded streets in the Jamaican capital, 
Kingston, and government offices and schools closed in the Caymans, 
a British colony of 28,000 people.Hurricane Mitch paused in its whirl through the western Caribbean

trees, sweeping away bridges, flooding neighborhoods and killing at 
least 32 people.``The hurricane has destroyed almost

thousands who are suffering.Hurricane Mitch killed an estimated 9,000 people throughout 
Central America in a disaster of such proportions that relief agencies 
have been overwhelmed.Better information from Honduras' ravaged countryside enabled officials 
to lower the confirmed death toll from Hurricane Mitch from 7,000 
to about 6,100 on Thursday, but leaders insisted the need for help 
was growing.He urged the more than 
1.5 million Hondurans affected by the storm to help with the recovery 
effort.``The county is semi-destroyed and awaits the maximum effort 
and most fervent and constant work of every one of its children,'' 
he said.As of 
Thursday, Mitch had killed 6,076 people in Honduras _ down from officials' 
earlier estimate of 7,000.El Salvador reported 239 dead; Guatemala said 194 of its 
people had been killed.In Washington on Thursday, President Bill 
Clinton ordered dlrs 30 million in Defense Department equipment and 
services and dlrs 36 million in food, fuel and other aid be sent to

America.Aid workers struggled Friday to reach survivors of Hurricane Mitch, 
who are in danger of dying from starvation and disease in the wake 
of the storm that officials estimate killed more than 10,000 people. 
Foreign aid and pledges of assistance poured into Central America, 
but damage to roads and bridges reduced the amount of supplies reaching 
hundreds of isolated communities to a trickle: only as much as could 
be dropped from a helicopter, when the aircraft can get through.Two British ships that were in the area on 
an exercise were on their way to Honduras to join relief efforts, 
the Defense Ministry said Friday.Nicaragua said Friday it will accept Cuba's offer to send doctors 
as long as the communist nation flies them in on its own helicopters 
and with their own supplies.","
Honduras braced for potential catastrophe Tuesday as Hurricane Mitch

intense rain that sent coastal residents scurrying for safer ground. 
President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of maximum alert 
and the Honduran military sent planes to pluck residents from their 
homes on islands near the coast.``Mitch is closing in,'' said Monterrey Cardenas, mayor of Utila, 
an island 20 miles (32 kilometers) off the Honduran coast.The Honduran 
president closed schools and public offices on the coast Monday and 
ordered all air force planes and helicopters to evacuate people from 
the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the country's 
central coast.The head of the Honduran armed forces, Gen. Mario Hung 
Pacheco, said 5,000 soldiers were standing by to help victims of the

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Tuesday approved 6.4 
million European currency units (dlrs 7.7 million) in aid for thousands 
of victims of the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch in Central 
America.EU spokesman Pietro Petrucci said the funds will be used 
to provide basic care such as medicine, food, water sanitation and 
blankets to thousands of people whose homes were destroyed by torrential 
rains and mudslides.The aid will be distributed in Nicaragua, El 
Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala which have most suffered from Mitch's 
deadly passage, the EU executive Commission said in a statement.Officials 
in Central America estimated Tuesday that about 7,000 people have 
died in the region.The greatest losses were reported in Honduras, 
where an estimated 5,000 people died and 600,000 people _ 10 percent 
of the population _ were forced to flee their homes after last week's 
storm.Pope John Paul II appealed for aid Wednesday for the Central American 
countries stricken by hurricane Mitch and said he feels close to the 
thousands who are suffering.Hurricane Mitch killed an estimated 9,000 people throughout 
Central America in a disaster of such proportions that relief agencies 
have been overwhelmed.Better information from Honduras' ravaged countryside enabled officials 
to lower the confirmed death toll from Hurricane Mitch from 7,000 
to about 6,100 on Thursday, but leaders insisted the need for help 
was growing.``The county is semi-destroyed and awaits the maximum effort 
and most fervent and constant work of every one of its children,''

Gore, to Central America on a mission to show the U.S. commitment

0,"The judge is 
probing Pinochet's role in the death of Spaniards in Chile under his 
rule in the 1970s and 80s.The Chilean government has protested Pinochet's 
arrest, insisting that as a senator he was traveling on a diplomatic 
passport and had immunity from arrest.Castro, Latin America's only 
remaining authoritarian leader, said he lacked details on the case 
against Pinochet, but said he thought it placed the government of 
Chile and President Eduardo Frei in an uncomfortable position while 
Frei is attending the summit.British police arrested Pinochet in 
his bed Friday at a private London hospital in response to a request 
from Spain, which wants to question Pinochet about allegations of 
murder during the decade after he seized power in 1973.Margaret Thatcher entertained former Children dictator Gen. Augusto 
Pinochet at her home two weeks before he was arrested in his bed in 
a London hospital, the ex-prime minister's office said Tuesday, amid 
growing diplomatic and domestic controversy over the move.Pinochet, 
who has vowed to fight attempts to extradite him to Spain on allegations 
of murder, genocide and torture, had drinks with Lady Thatcher and 
her husband, Denis, in their home in London's elite Belgravia district 
four days before he was hospitalized for back surgery performed Oct. 
9.Pinochet, expected to be hospitalized 
for perhaps two more weeks faces a long battle through British courts 
to avoid extradition, questioning by two Spanish judges who instigated 
the proceedings, and an appearance at London's Bow Street magistrate's 
court.The Spanish and British governments appeared Wednesday to be seeking 
shelter from the political storm brewing over the possible extradition 
of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain.``Despite everything 
that has been written, this is not a decision for the British government 
or the Spanish government,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said 
in an interview published by a Spanish newspaper on Wednesday.British police, acting on an international arrest warrant 
from Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon on Friday, detained the ailing 
general in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery. 
The detention and the possible extradition of Pinochet to Spain to 
stand trial for genocide, terrorism and torture during his 17-year 
dictatorship was warmly welcomed by human rights activists worldwide. 
Blair quoted in the El Mundo newspaper said that 
Pinochet's detention was unrelated to his government's so-called Ethical 
Foreign Policy, apparently ignoring pressure from leftists within 
his Labor party to support moves to prosecute the former dictator. 
Blair added that should 
Home Secretary Jack Straw would use only strictly legal criteria and 
act ``as if he were a judge,'' should he be required to make a decision 
on an extradition request from Spain.``Depending on 
the result of the appeals it is possible that it (the extradition 
request) will never reach the government so perhaps the government 
will never have to pronounce on it,'' Aznar was quoted as saying in 
Wednesday's edition of the Madrid newspaper El Pais.The appeals argue 
that crimes committed during Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship are 
none of Spain's business, and should be left to the Chilean or international 
courts.A delegation of Chilean legislators lobbying against the possible 
extradition of Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial, warned Thursday 
that Chile was on the brink of political turmoil.Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 at the instigation 
of Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon who is seeking to extradite 
the former dictator on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. 
The delegation is an offshoot of a larger group 
of Chilean parliamentarians currently protesting the detention in 
London on behalf of the opposition parties Independent Democratic 
Union and the National Renovation Party.Aznar has promised his government 
will rubber stamp a formal extradition request to the British government 
if asked to do so by the judicial authorities.On Thursday 
the head prosecutor from the National Court set in motion appeals 
against several rulings made by Judge Garzon related to Pinochet's 
detention in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery. 
The court's plenary is expected to meet next week to decide on an 
earlier challenge of the Spanish judicial investigations into human 
rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest 
warrant.Europe's top official said Friday that he hoped former Chilean dictator 
Augusto Pinochet would be extradited to Spain to be tried for crimes 
committed during his 17-year rule.Pinochet was detained 
by British police in London on Oct. 16 by request of a Spanish magistrate 
as a first step toward his extradition to stand trial for genocide 
and terrorism.``If Augusto knew the truth, he would have 
an attack of rage and die,'' El Mundo quoted Hiriart as saying to 
others while waiting for permission from Scotland Yard to visit her 
husband on the eighth floor of the clinic.According to the report Pinochet was informed 
of the arrest order from two policemen, but is convinced it was a 
mistake and that he is protected by diplomatic immunity.The wife of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet appealed for 
his release, saying he is too sick to be extradited to Spain to face 
charges of genocide. ''This is very painful for our family,'' a tearful 
Lucia Pinochet told reporters late Friday outside the private London 
Clinic, where her husband is under arrest as he recuperates from back 
surgery.He 
was arrested Oct. 16 at the instigation of a Spanish magistrate seeking 
to extradite him on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture.In a separate attempt to block his extradition, lawyers 
for the former strongman went to court Friday to argue that British 
police acted illegally in accepting the Spanish warrant.The British and Spanish prime ministers said Sunday that the fate 
of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet is in the hands of 
their judicial authorities and they will not interfere.He was detained on a warrant from a Spanish magistrate 
seeking to extradite him on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture 
during his 1973-90 rule.Weekend newspaper reports in Spain said 
a Spanish judge who ordered Pinochet's arrest has issued a petition 
aimed at freezing any accounts the 82-year-old general might have 
in Luxembourg and Switzerland.Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon is seeking his extradition on charges 
of genocide, torture and terrorism during his 17-year rule which ended 
1990.As his lawyers in London tried to quash a Spanish arrest warrant for 
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, efforts began 
in Geneva and Paris to have him extradited.In London, where Pinochet 
has been under arrest in a clinic for the last 10 days, a phalanx 
of British lawyers argued before the High Court of Justice that the 
arrest order sent from Spain was illegal because the general, 82, 
is not a Spanish citizen.His lawyer, Clive Nicholls, said that if a bid to extradite 
the general succeeded, by the same token Queen Elizabeth II could 
be extradited to Argentina to face trial for the death of Argentine 
soldiers in the Falklands war in 1982.On the opposing side, Alun 
Jones, a British government lawyer acting as prosecutor in the case, 
defended the Spanish warrant, which led to the general's detention 
in London.The prosecutor argued that the the right-wing general was 
responsible for killing at least 4,000 people and had set out ``to 
destroy a national group _ Chilean nationals who did not share his 
ideological values.''After hearing the arguments in a court crowded 
with Chilean exiles in the public gallery, Lord Bingham, Britain's 
senior judge, said the court was expected to decide the matter on 
Tuesday.In Geneva, a public prosecutor, 
Bernard Bertossa, said Monday that he had issued a warrant for Pinochet's 
arrest in connection with the kidnapping and presumed death of a Swiss-Chilean 
citizen in 1977.Bertossa said he had opened a judicial investigation 
in response to a complaint by the widow of the victim, Alexei Jaccard, 
who was 25 when he was tortured in Chile and subsequently disappeared. 
The prosecutor said he was asking the Swiss federal government to 
seek Pinochet's extradition from Britain to face trial in Geneva. 
At the same time in Paris Monday, the families of three French citizens, 
of whom two disappeared and one was killed in Chile during the 1973-90 
dictatorship, filed suit in a French court.In Madrid, Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish investigating 
magistrate who first obtained Pinochet's arrest in London, said he 
had formally requested the governments of Switzerland and Luxemburg 
to block bank accounts held by the general.In London, British 
officials keep insisting that Pinochet's case will be decided by the 
courts and not politically, yet the issue has stirred intense political 
activity both in Britain and in Chile.Supporters and opponents of 
the dictator have traveled to the London clinic where he is being

in office.His lawyer, Clive Nicholls, said that if a bid to extradite 
the general succeeded, by the same token Queen Elizabeth II could 
be extradited to Argentina to face trial for the death of Argentine 
soldiers in the Falklands war in 1982.The prosecutor argued that the the right-wing general was 
responsible for killing at least 4,000 people and had set out ``to 
destroy a national group _ Chilean nationals who did not share his 
ideological values.''After hearing the arguments in a court crowded 
with Chilean exiles in the public gallery, Lord Bingham, Britain's

in response to a complaint by the widow of the victim, Alexei Jaccard,

At the same time in Paris Monday, the families of three French citizens, 
of whom two disappeared and one was killed in Chile during the 1973-90 
dictatorship, filed suit in a French court.Court officials in Madrid 
said Garzon wanted any accounts blocked with a view to their possible 
use later as compensation to relatives of victims.In London, British 
officials keep insisting that Pinochet's case will be decided by the 
courts and not politically, yet the issue has stirred intense political 
activity both in Britain and in Chile.Supporters and opponents of 
the dictator have traveled to the London clinic where he is being 
held.The political and legal imbroglio could 
end if Britain's home secretary, Jack Straw, decides that the general 
should be released on ``compassionate grounds'' because of his age 
and failing health.Last week he said that in exercising his powers 
under the 1989 Extradition Act, he would consider whether the offenses 
are of a ``political character'' and he would take into account ``any 
compassionate circumstances.''

Cuban President Fidel Castro said Sunday he disagreed with the arrest 
in London of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, calling it 
a case of ``international meddling.''The judge is 
probing Pinochet's role in the death of Spaniards in Chile under his 
rule in the 1970s and 80s.The Chilean government has protested Pinochet's 
arrest, insisting that as a senator he was traveling on a diplomatic 
passport and had immunity from arrest.Castro, Latin America's only 
remaining authoritarian leader, said he lacked details on the case 
against Pinochet, but said he thought it placed the government of 
Chile and President Eduardo Frei in an uncomfortable position while 
Frei is attending the summit.``Now they are talking about the arrest of Pinochet 
instead of the summit,'' he said.Britain has defended its arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, with one 
lawmaker saying that Chile's claim that the former Chilean dictator 
has diplomatic immunity is ridiculous.British police arrested Pinochet in 
his bed Friday at a private London hospital in response to a request 
from Spain, which wants to question Pinochet about allegations of 
murder during the decade after he seized power in 1973.Pinochet, commander-in-chief 
of the Chilean army until March, has immunity from prosecution in 
Chile as a senator-for-life under a new constitution that his government 
crafted.Pinochet, 
who has vowed to fight attempts to extradite him to Spain on allegations 
of murder, genocide and torture, had drinks with Lady Thatcher and 
her husband, Denis, in their home in London's elite Belgravia district 
four days before he was hospitalized for back surgery performed Oct. 
9.He arrived last month on a diplomatic 
passport and is also a senator-for-life in Chile, which protects him 
from prosecution there.Pinochet's 17-year-rule was marked by torture 
and other human rights abuses against political opponents in which, 
the Chilean government has said, 4,299 people were killed or vanished. 
The Spanish and British governments appeared Wednesday to be seeking 
shelter from the political storm brewing over the possible extradition 
of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain.``Despite everything 
that has been written, this is not a decision for the British government 
or the Spanish government,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said 
in an interview published by a Spanish newspaper on Wednesday.British police, acting on an international arrest warrant

act ``as if he were a judge,'' should he be required to make a decision

Jose Maria Aznar has promised his government would rubber stamp the 
process if it reaches his desk, he appears to be hoping he will never 
have to do so.``Depending on 
the result of the appeals it is possible that it (the extradition 
request) will never reach the government so perhaps the government 
will never have to pronounce on it,'' Aznar was quoted as saying in 
Wednesday's edition of the Madrid newspaper El Pais.The appeals argue 
that crimes committed during Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship are 
none of Spain's business, and should be left to the Chilean or international 
courts.A delegation of Chilean legislators lobbying against the possible 
extradition of Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial, warned Thursday 
that Chile was on the brink of political turmoil.Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 at the instigation

the former dictator on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. 
Aznar has promised his government 
will rubber stamp a formal extradition request to the British government 
if asked to do so by the judicial authorities.On Thursday 
the head prosecutor from the National Court set in motion appeals 
against several rulings made by Judge Garzon related to Pinochet's 
detention in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery. 
The court's plenary is expected to meet next week to decide on an 
earlier challenge of the Spanish judicial investigations into human 
rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest 
warrant.Europe's top official said Friday that he hoped former Chilean dictator 
Augusto Pinochet would be extradited to Spain to be tried for crimes 
committed during his 17-year rule.Pinochet was detained 
by British police in London on Oct. 16 by request of a Spanish magistrate 
as a first step toward his extradition to stand trial for genocide 
and terrorism.``If Augusto knew the truth, he would have 
an attack of rage and die,'' El Mundo quoted Hiriart as saying to 
others while waiting for permission from Scotland Yard to visit her 
husband on the eighth floor of the clinic.According to the report Pinochet was informed 
of the arrest order from two policemen, but is convinced it was a 
mistake and that he is protected by diplomatic immunity.The wife of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet appealed for 
his release, saying he is too sick to be extradited to Spain to face 
charges of genocide. ''This is very painful for our family,'' a tearful 
Lucia Pinochet told reporters late Friday outside the private London 
Clinic, where her husband is under arrest as he recuperates from back 
surgery.He 
was arrested Oct. 16 at the instigation of a Spanish magistrate seeking 
to extradite him on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture.In a separate attempt to block his extradition, lawyers

end if Britain's home secretary, Jack Straw, decides that the general 
should be released on ``compassionate grounds'' because of his age 
and failing health.Last week he said that in exercising his powers 
under the 1989 Extradition Act, he would consider whether the offenses 
are of a ``political character'' and he would take into account ``any 
compassionate circumstances.''

Cuban President Fidel Castro said Sunday he disagreed with the arrest 
in London of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, calling it 
a case of ``international meddling.''The Chilean government has protested Pinochet's 
arrest, insisting that as a senator he was traveling on a diplomatic 
passport and had immunity from arrest.Castro, Latin America's only 
remaining authoritarian leader, said he lacked details on the case 
against Pinochet, but said he thought it placed the government of 
Chile and President Eduardo Frei in an uncomfortable position while 
Frei is attending the summit.Britain has defended its arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, with one 
lawmaker saying that Chile's claim that the former Chilean dictator 
has diplomatic immunity is ridiculous.British police arrested Pinochet in 
his bed Friday at a private London hospital in response to a request 
from Spain, which wants to question Pinochet about allegations of 
murder during the decade after he seized power in 1973.``The idea that 
such a brutal dictator as Pinochet should be claiming diplomatic immunity 
I think for most people in this country would be pretty gut-wrenching 
stuff,'' Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson said in a British Broadcasting 
Corp. television interview Sunday.``Spain also lived under an authoritarian 
for 40 years and many of its present institutions are inherited from 
that regime,'' Frei said in Porto, Portugal, where he was attending 
the Ibero-American Summit.Pinochet, commander-in-chief 
of the Chilean army until March, has immunity from prosecution in 
Chile as a senator-for-life under a new constitution that his government

Pinochet at her home two weeks before he was arrested in his bed in 
a London hospital, the ex-prime minister's office said Tuesday, amid 
growing diplomatic and domestic controversy over the move.Pinochet, 
who has vowed to fight attempts to extradite him to Spain on allegations 
of murder, genocide and torture, had drinks with Lady Thatcher and 
her husband, Denis, in their home in London's elite Belgravia district

for perhaps two more weeks faces a long battle through British courts 
to avoid extradition, questioning by two Spanish judges who instigated 
the proceedings, and an appearance at London's Bow Street magistrate's 
court.The Spanish and British governments appeared Wednesday to be seeking 
shelter from the political storm brewing over the possible extradition 
of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain.``Despite everything 
that has been written, this is not a decision for the British government

in an interview published by a Spanish newspaper on Wednesday.British police, acting on an international arrest warrant 
from Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon on Friday, detained the ailing 
general in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery. 
The detention and the possible extradition of Pinochet to Spain to 
stand trial for genocide, terrorism and torture during his 17-year 
dictatorship was warmly welcomed by human rights activists worldwide. 
Blair quoted in the El Mundo newspaper said that 
Pinochet's detention was unrelated to his government's so-called Ethical 
Foreign Policy, apparently ignoring pressure from leftists within 
his Labor party to support moves to prosecute the former dictator. 
Blair added that should 
Home Secretary Jack Straw would use only strictly legal criteria and 
act ``as if he were a judge,'' should he be required to make a decision 
on an extradition request from Spain.The tone of the British Prime 
Minister's first public comment on the issue contrasted sharply with 
Sunday's emotional statement from influential Trade Secretary Peter 
Mandelson who said most Britons would find diplomatic immunity for 
Pinochet ``gut-wrenching.''``Depending on 
the result of the appeals it is possible that it (the extradition 
request) will never reach the government so perhaps the government

has been under arrest in a clinic for the last 10 days, a phalanx

the general succeeded, by the same token Queen Elizabeth II could 
be extradited to Argentina to face trial for the death of Argentine 
soldiers in the Falklands war in 1982.The prosecutor argued that the the right-wing general was 
responsible for killing at least 4,000 people and had set out ``to 
destroy a national group _ Chilean nationals who did not share his 
ideological values.''After hearing the arguments in a court crowded 
with Chilean exiles in the public gallery, Lord Bingham, Britain's

citizen in 1977.Bertossa said he had opened a judicial investigation 
in response to a complaint by the widow of the victim, Alexei Jaccard,

courts and not politically, yet the issue has stirred intense political 
activity both in Britain and in Chile.From Chile have come six right-wing senators, the deputy foreign 
minister, aides and legal experts who file in and out of the private

A delegation of Chilean legislators lobbying against the possible 
extradition of Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial, warned Thursday 
that Chile was on the brink of political turmoil.Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 at the instigation 
of Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon who is seeking to extradite 
the former dictator on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. 
The delegation is an offshoot of a larger group 
of Chilean parliamentarians currently protesting the detention in 
London on behalf of the opposition parties Independent Democratic 
Union and the National Renovation Party.On Thursday 
the head prosecutor from the National Court set in motion appeals 
against several rulings made by Judge Garzon related to Pinochet's

The court's plenary is expected to meet next week to decide on an 
earlier challenge of the Spanish judicial investigations into human 
rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest 
warrant.The decision 
is likely to hang on how genocide and terrorism are interpreted, as 
these crimes are specifically mentioned in the Spanish legal code.

in an interview published by a Spanish newspaper on Wednesday.British police, acting on an international arrest warrant 
from Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon on Friday, detained the ailing 
general in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery. 
The detention and the possible extradition of Pinochet to Spain to 
stand trial for genocide, terrorism and torture during his 17-year 
dictatorship was warmly welcomed by human rights activists worldwide. 
Blair quoted in the El Mundo newspaper said that 
Pinochet's detention was unrelated to his government's so-called Ethical 
Foreign Policy, apparently ignoring pressure from leftists within 
his Labor party to support moves to prosecute the former dictator. 
Blair added that should 
Home Secretary Jack Straw would use only strictly legal criteria and 
act ``as if he were a judge,'' should he be required to make a decision 
on an extradition request from Spain.The tone of the British Prime 
Minister's first public comment on the issue contrasted sharply with 
Sunday's emotional statement from influential Trade Secretary Peter 
Mandelson who said most Britons would find diplomatic immunity for 
Pinochet ``gut-wrenching.''The European extradition convention gives 
Garzon 40 days to present a formal extradition request to the British 
authorities via the Spanish government.``Depending on 
the result of the appeals it is possible that it (the extradition 
request) will never reach the government so perhaps the government 
will never have to pronounce on it,'' Aznar was quoted as saying in 
Wednesday's edition of the Madrid newspaper El Pais.A delegation of Chilean legislators lobbying against the possible 
extradition of Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial, warned Thursday 
that Chile was on the brink of political turmoil.Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 at the instigation 
of Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon who is seeking to extradite 
the former dictator on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. 
The delegation is an offshoot of a larger group 
of Chilean parliamentarians currently protesting the detention in 
London on behalf of the opposition parties Independent Democratic 
Union and the National Renovation Party.On Thursday 
the head prosecutor from the National Court set in motion appeals 
against several rulings made by Judge Garzon related to Pinochet's 
detention in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery. 
The court's plenary is expected to meet next week to decide on an 
earlier challenge of the Spanish judicial investigations into human 
rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest 
warrant.Pinochet was detained 
by British police in London on Oct. 16 by request of a Spanish magistrate 
as a first step toward his extradition to stand trial for genocide 
and terrorism.Santer was speaking to reporters in the northern 
Spanish city of Oviedo where he was due to receive the Prince of Asturias 
Prize for social science _``If Augusto knew the truth, he would have 
an attack of rage and die,'' El Mundo quoted Hiriart as saying to 
others while waiting for permission from Scotland Yard to visit her 
husband on the eighth floor of the clinic.The wife of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet appealed for 
his release, saying he is too sick to be extradited to Spain to face 
charges of genocide. ''This is very painful for our family,'' a tearful 
Lucia Pinochet told reporters late Friday outside the private London 
Clinic, where her husband is under arrest as he recuperates from back 
surgery.He 
was arrested Oct. 16 at the instigation of a Spanish magistrate seeking 
to extradite him on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture.In a separate attempt to block his extradition, lawyers 
for the former strongman went to court Friday to argue that British 
police acted illegally in accepting the Spanish warrant.The British and Spanish prime ministers said Sunday that the fate 
of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet is in the hands of 
their judicial authorities and they will not interfere.He was detained on a warrant from a Spanish magistrate 
seeking to extradite him on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture 
during his 1973-90 rule.Weekend newspaper reports in Spain said 
a Spanish judge who ordered Pinochet's arrest has issued a petition 
aimed at freezing any accounts the 82-year-old general might have 
in Luxembourg and Switzerland.Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon is seeking his extradition on charges 
of genocide, torture and terrorism during his 17-year rule which ended 
1990.As his lawyers in London tried to quash a Spanish arrest warrant for 
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, efforts began 
in Geneva and Paris to have him extradited.In London, where Pinochet 
has been under arrest in a clinic for the last 10 days, a phalanx 
of British lawyers argued before the High Court of Justice that the 
arrest order sent from Spain was illegal because the general, 82, 
is not a Spanish citizen.His lawyer, Clive Nicholls, said that if a bid to extradite 
the general succeeded, by the same token Queen Elizabeth II could 
be extradited to Argentina to face trial for the death of Argentine 
soldiers in the Falklands war in 1982.On the opposing side, Alun 
Jones, a British government lawyer acting as prosecutor in the case, 
defended the Spanish warrant, which led to the general's detention 
in London.The prosecutor argued that the the right-wing general was 
responsible for killing at least 4,000 people and had set out ``to 
destroy a national group _ Chilean nationals who did not share his 
ideological values.''After hearing the arguments in a court crowded 
with Chilean exiles in the public gallery, Lord Bingham, Britain's 
senior judge, said the court was expected to decide the matter on 
Tuesday.In Geneva, a public prosecutor, 
Bernard Bertossa, said Monday that he had issued a warrant for Pinochet's 
arrest in connection with the kidnapping and presumed death of a Swiss-Chilean 
citizen in 1977.Bertossa said he had opened a judicial investigation 
in response to a complaint by the widow of the victim, Alexei Jaccard, 
who was 25 when he was tortured in Chile and subsequently disappeared. 
At the same time in Paris Monday, the families of three French citizens, 
of whom two disappeared and one was killed in Chile during the 1973-90 
dictatorship, filed suit in a French court.In Madrid, Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish investigating 
magistrate who first obtained Pinochet's arrest in London, said he 
had formally requested the governments of Switzerland and Luxemburg 
to block bank accounts held by the general.In London, British 
officials keep insisting that Pinochet's case will be decided by the 
courts and not politically, yet the issue has stirred intense political 
activity both in Britain and in Chile.The political and legal imbroglio could 
end if Britain's home secretary, Jack Straw, decides that the general 
should be released on ``compassionate grounds'' because of his age 
and failing health.Last week he said that in exercising his powers 
under the 1989 Extradition Act, he would consider whether the offenses 
are of a ``political character'' and he would take into account ``any 
compassionate circumstances.'' 
"
0,"And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, the man 
Washington calls Enemy No. 1 and blames for the Aug. 7 bombings of 
U.S. embassies in East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said an 
interview with The Associated Press.``America fears its shadow ... in every 
part of the world it is afraid and sees every danger connected to 
bin Laden,'' he said in an interview in the Afghan capital of Kabul. 
The Taliban have refused 
to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there 
is evidence they will try him under Islamic law.FBI agents this week began questioning relatives 
of the victims of the Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombing as well as the seriously 
injured on request of the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern 
District of New York, a U.S. official said Thursday.The official, 
who could not be further identified, said the questioning was aimed 
at gathering recorded testimony to be used by the prosecution in the 
pre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection 
with the attack.Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the 
alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to attack U.S. targets around the 
world, and Muhammad Atef, the alleged military commander of bin Laden's 
terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, were charged in a separate 238-page 
indictment with murder and conspiracy in the bombings.Bin Laden is 
believed to be living in Afghanistan.Police seized copies of the newspaper 
for reproducing a foreign newspaper interview of Afghanistan-based 
Saudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden, who has been accused by the United 
States of masterminding bombing attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya 
and Tanzania in August.The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania 
and Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he 
has lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban 
militia.The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, 
on Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama 
bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States.The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political 
activity is banned and he has agreed to respect that, the Taliban 
information minister said in a statement Friday.Albania says it has uncovered a terrorist network operated by Osama 
Bin Laden, the Islamic fundamentalist accused of masterminding the 
August embassy bombings in Africa, and that it's members have infiltrated 
other parts of Europe, The Sunday Times reported.Bin 
Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in 1994 
after telling the government that he was head of a wealthy Saudi humanitarian 
agency wishing to help in Albania, the newspaper reported. 
 
The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a 
Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month 
to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind 
of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, according to 
U.S. intelligence officials.The evidence, the officials said last 
week, shows that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical 
plant in Khartoum, has had financial dealings with members of Islamic 
Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination there 
of President Anwar Sadat in 1981.Some State Department and CIA 
officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based 
on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden. 
The criticism is also based on the suspicion that the United States 
has poor data on Sudan, as the CIA station there has been closed since 
1995 and the entire U.S. Embassy since 1996.Senior administration officials 
say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence 
of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, 
but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. 
Officials say U.S. intelligence 
has received reports that Idris launders money for international Islamic 
groups, and that he also has a stake in a company in Sudan that is 
40 percent owned by the Military Industrial Corporation, a government 
entity that the United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons 
development.Bin Laden has helped finance the Military Industrial 
Corp. in his effort to use Sudan as a base for chemical weapons production, 
and talked to Sudanese leaders about testing poisonous gases against 
U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, according to U.S. intelligence.One of the clear but unstated objectives of last August's raid on 
Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and as many of his lieutenants 
as possible, administration officials now acknowledge.The officials said the raid was 
timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps 
at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would 
be meeting there with his chief operatives.But officials said the White House legal opinion 
drafted before the Afghan strike asserts that the president has authority 
to target the ``infrastructure'' of terrorist groups that are attacking 
Americans.``As 
we said from the time of the Aug. 20 strike, the objective was to 
disrupt the training, organization and infrastructure of the bin Laden 
terrorist network at the Khost camps,'' said David C. Leavy, a spokesman 
for the National Security Council at the White House.U.S. intelligence officials say they now believe that 
bin Laden was in the camp on the day of the attack, but he appears 
to have left unscathed before the missiles hit.Officials said there 
were reports that at least one of his senior lieutenants may have 
died in the attack, and that total casualties in the complex were 
between 50 and 100.Administration 
officials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill 
bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors 
with leading a global war against U.S. interests.But a 
less subtle explanation was offered on Oct. 13 by Defense Secretary 
William Cohen, who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United 
States had been ``going after'' bin Laden and his colleagues.That review, officials said, 
provided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the 
meeting at which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would 
be gathered.He was worried, 
he wrote in an angry dispatch, about the security of the ``East Africa 
network'' of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of masterminding a 
worldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans.The writer, who 
federal authorities believe was Haroun Fazil, who was to become one 
of the central suspects in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi 
a year later, noted with alarm British press reports about the arrest 
of an aide to bin Laden.Striking almost bureaucratic tones, he said 
he was worried that ``an important man with close links'' to bin Laden, 
seemed to have ``fallen into the enemy's hands.''He said the Americans 
were breathing down the necks of his associates in Nairobi and that 
he had to take precautions.He refers to himself as the media information officer of the East 
Africa cell and complains that he is not being kept in the loop on 
big decisions.Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document 
seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against 
bin Laden: That he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that 
his operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin Laden's 
door by federal authorities _He said his comrades in East 
Africa ``should know that there is an American-Kenyan-Egyptian intelligence 
activity in Nairobi aiming to identify the names and residences of 
the members who are associated with the sheik since America knows 
well that the youth who lived in Somalia and were members of the sheik's 
cell are the ones who killed Americans in Somalia.''The government has asserted that one of Fazil's duties was to prepare 
and transmit reports to bin Laden and his top lieutenants.Federal 
authorities said that Khalid al Fawwaz, a London-based associate of 
bin Laden, directed Fazil to ``report periodically to bin Laden about 
the ``security'' situation of the cell.It is not 
clear from the materials whether the report in the computer was forwarded 
to bin Laden.He repeatedly 
expressed his fears of American intelligence, which he believed was 
in the midst of a worldwide search for bin Laden and his associates. 
The author noted with alarm a recent 
CIA operation in which a man accused of shooting agency employees 
had been lured across the border in Pakistan and returned to the United 
States for trial.He said that 
the group did not have to inform its Nairobi-based operatives of all 
its global plans, but they needed enough warning to go ``underground 
for a while'' if authorities intensified the pressure in Nairobi. 
According to the government, 
the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period 
when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere.From the court papers filed 
in the investigation of the embassy bombings in East Africa in August, 
it is clear that the informant has provided crucial information to 
federal investigators.They have cited the source in the papers filed 
to support the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who are 
under arrest in Germany and Britain.The source is also the basis 
for many of the significant charges in the indictment against bin 
Laden himself, including the assertion that he directed the attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and that he attempted to obtain nuclear 
weapons.But at least one operative 
of bin Laden's group in East Africa concluded more than a year ago 
that he knew the identity of a crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, a businessman 
who was married to one of bin Laden's relatives.``An important man with close 
links to'' bin Laden ``seems to have fallen into the enemy's hands, 
and we have to take all the appropriate security precautions against 
that,'' the operative, Haroun Fazil, wrote in his summary of security 
concerns.In one recent filing, they said their case 
will in part be ``based on the testimony'' of the confidential source, 
suggesting that the informant has agreed to testify at any trial of 
bin Laden or his associates.In 
the affidavit prepared last week, the source acknowledged pleading 
guilty to terrorism charges in the United States and said they stemmed 
from attacks on U.S. targets, which were not specifically identified.

part of the world it is afraid and sees every danger connected to

the bombing of the U.S. embassies, the officials said.But intelligence 
agents previously obtained evidence that the manager of the Shifa 
plant made frequent trips to Iraq, where he visited the head of the 
chemical weapons program.In addition, a soil sample that the CIA 
clandestinely took at the Shifa plant showed the presence of a chemical 
used in the production of VX nerve gas, a process used only by Iraq. 
Some State Department and CIA 
officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based 
on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden.

under U.S. and international law.But officials said the White House legal opinion

to target the ``infrastructure'' of terrorist groups that are attacking

of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 
7 of this year.Officials of the FBI and the 
U.S. attorney's office in New York City refused to say Tuesday night 
at what point FBI agents learned of the computer file, nor would they 
make any other comment.Fazil eluded American investigators after 
the bombing as he traveled from Kenya to his home in the Comoros Islands 
and then to the Middle East.The dispatch provides 
a remarkable insight into the workings of a terrorist network in the 
twilight of the 20th century.He refers to himself as the media information officer of the East 
Africa cell and complains that he is not being kept in the loop on 
big decisions.Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document 
seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against

his operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin Laden's

``become America's primary target.''He said his comrades in East 
Africa ``should know that there is an American-Kenyan-Egyptian intelligence

support the extradition of Fawwaz for trial in New York.The author noted with alarm a recent 
CIA operation in which a man accused of shooting agency employees 
had been lured across the border in Pakistan and returned to the United 
States for trial.On Aug. 7, they charge, Fazil 
drove a pickup truck to the embassy, leading the way for a vehicle 
carrying the bomb that killed more than 200 people, including 12 Americans. 
He said that 
the group did not have to inform its Nairobi-based operatives of all 
its global plans, but they needed enough warning to go ``underground 
for a while'' if authorities intensified the pressure in Nairobi. 
If Osama bin Laden ever stands trial in New York for the bombings 
of the U.S. embassies in Africa and other acts of terror, it is already 
clear who prosecutors will call as a chief witness:The 
government has identified the aide in court papers with the pseudonym 
CS-1, saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret 
proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan.According to the government, 
the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period 
when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere.From the court papers filed

of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, 
but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. 
Officials say U.S. intelligence 
has received reports that Idris launders money for international Islamic 
groups, and that he also has a stake in a company in Sudan that is 
40 percent owned by the Military Industrial Corporation, a government 
entity that the United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons 
development.Bin Laden has helped finance the Military Industrial 
Corp. in his effort to use Sudan as a base for chemical weapons production, 
and talked to Sudanese leaders about testing poisonous gases against 
U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, according to U.S. intelligence.One of the clear but unstated objectives of last August's raid on 
Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and as many of his lieutenants 
as possible, administration officials now acknowledge.The officials said the raid was 
timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps 
at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would 
be meeting there with his chief operatives.But officials said the White House legal opinion 
drafted before the Afghan strike asserts that the president has authority 
to target the ``infrastructure'' of terrorist groups that are attacking 
Americans.``As 
we said from the time of the Aug. 20 strike, the objective was to 
disrupt the training, organization and infrastructure of the bin Laden 
terrorist network at the Khost camps,'' said David C. Leavy, a spokesman 
for the National Security Council at the White House.Administration 
officials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill 
bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors 
with leading a global war against U.S. interests.But a 
less subtle explanation was offered on Oct. 13 by Defense Secretary 
William Cohen, who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United 
States had been ``going after'' bin Laden and his colleagues.He was worried, 
he wrote in an angry dispatch, about the security of the ``East Africa 
network'' of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of masterminding a 
worldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans.The writer, who 
federal authorities believe was Haroun Fazil, who was to become one 
of the central suspects in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi 
a year later, noted with alarm British press reports about the arrest 
of an aide to bin Laden.The letter, an extraordinary bit of digital 
evidence in a cloak-and-dagger case, was retrieved from a computer 
in a house where Fazil had been staying, according to papers filed 
in U.S. District Court in New York City.The documents did not make clear whether 
the FBI had translated and read the document before or after the bombings 
of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 
7 of this year.The timing is potentially important because there 
have been mounting questions since the bombings about whether the 
United States adequately followed up warnings of a possible terrorist 
attack on American targets in Kenya.Officials of the FBI and the 
U.S. attorney's office in New York City refused to say Tuesday night 
at what point FBI agents learned of the computer file, nor would they 
make any other comment.Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document 
seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against 
bin Laden: That he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that 
his operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin Laden's 
door by federal authorities _He said his comrades in East 
Africa ``should know that there is an American-Kenyan-Egyptian intelligence 
activity in Nairobi aiming to identify the names and residences of 
the members who are associated with the sheik since America knows 
well that the youth who lived in Somalia and were members of the sheik's 
cell are the ones who killed Americans in Somalia.''The author noted with alarm a recent 
CIA operation in which a man accused of shooting agency employees 
had been lured across the border in Pakistan and returned to the United 
States for trial.He said that 
the group did not have to inform its Nairobi-based operatives of all 
its global plans, but they needed enough warning to go ``underground 
for a while'' if authorities intensified the pressure in Nairobi. 
The 
government has identified the aide in court papers with the pseudonym 
CS-1, saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret 
proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan.According to the government, 
the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period 
when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere.From the court papers filed 
in the investigation of the embassy bombings in East Africa in August, 
it is clear that the informant has provided crucial information to 
federal investigators.The source is also the basis 
for many of the significant charges in the indictment against bin 
Laden himself, including the assertion that he directed the attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and that he attempted to obtain nuclear 
weapons.But at least one operative 
of bin Laden's group in East Africa concluded more than a year ago 
that he knew the identity of a crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, a businessman 
who was married to one of bin Laden's relatives.In an August, 1997 article, The Daily 
Telegraph said Tayyib had been in custody in Saudi Arabia since May 
and had given intelligence officials details of bin Laden's bank accounts 
and businesses.``An important man with close 
links to'' bin Laden ``seems to have fallen into the enemy's hands, 
and we have to take all the appropriate security precautions against 
that,'' the operative, Haroun Fazil, wrote in his summary of security 
concerns.In one recent filing, they said their case 
will in part be ``based on the testimony'' of the confidential source, 
suggesting that the informant has agreed to testify at any trial of 
bin Laden or his associates.In 
the affidavit prepared last week, the source acknowledged pleading 
guilty to terrorism charges in the United States and said they stemmed 
from attacks on U.S. targets, which were not specifically identified. 
","U.S. prosecutors have asked for a 20-day extension 
to provide Germany with paperwork necessary to extradite a top lieutenant 
of Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden, officials said Saturday. 
``America is looking for an excuse to fire 
more rockets on our dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden,'' 
Saqib said.Washington, which has posted a dlrs 5 million reward for 
bin Laden's arrest, hasn't ruled out further attacks on Afghanistan. 
In Afghanistan, bin Laden is considered an honored guest by his Taliban 
hosts.So far Saqib says he has no evidence of bin 
Laden's involvement in terrorist activities.The Taliban have refused 
to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there 
is evidence they will try him under Islamic law.``We want good relations 
with the United States and all Muslim and non-Muslim countries, but 
they have to respect our ways,'' he said.Saqib said his inquiry will 
wind up on Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence against bin Laden the 
case will be closed _ at least for the Taliban.``Bin Laden is not 
a sinful man ...America has been silent ... they have given no evidence,'' 
he said.``It is too shameful for America who is now seen by all that 
world to have no reason to go after bin Laden.''Bin Laden is 
believed to be living in Afghanistan.Those arrested need not be taken to court 
for trial for up to three months.Men must grow beards of a certain length and criminals 
are subjected to amputations and public executions Even though Bangladesh 
is a predominantly Muslim country, it is governed by secular laws. 
``Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin. ...He is 
a free man.''The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political 
activity is banned and he has agreed to respect that, the Taliban 
information minister said in a statement Friday.The minister, Amir 
Khan Muttaqi, also disputed U.S. assertions that bin Laden is a rich 
man, saying the Saudi dissident has had his foreign assets frozen, 
a claim not immediately corroborated. 
 
Kader claimed 
during the trial that he had visited Albania to recruit and arm fighters 
for Kosovo, and that four of his associates were still at large.Bin 
Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in 1994 
after telling the government that he was head of a wealthy Saudi humanitarian 
agency wishing to help in Albania, the newspaper reported. 
 
Islamic Jihad, in turn, receives 
money and sponsorship from bin Laden and has been absorbed into his 
terror network, the officials added.A spokesman 
for Idris denied the accusations, saying Idris had no ties either 
to bin Laden or to any Islamic terrorist groups.In a statement provided 
by Tim Pendry, his London-based adviser, Idris said: ``I have absolutely 
no relationship with any Islamic terrorist organization anywhere in 
the world.I have never met Mr. bin Laden, I have never spoken with 
him, I have never had any financial or business relationship with 
him, nor knowingly with anyone acting as his agent.''Officials said they were 
not certain what the Iraqis were now doing in Khartoum.Some State Department and CIA 
officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based 
on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden. 
``What we knew about the ownership was that 
a lot of it couldn't be reliably established,'' said one senior U.S. 
intelligence official.But Pendry 
denied that Idris owned any businesses withBut they said that Islamic Jihad had now been consolidated into bin 
Laden's terrorist campaign. 
 
The officials said the raid was 
timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps 
at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would 
be meeting there with his chief operatives.Senior administration officials said they never 
discussed killing bin Laden in their planning sessions.Administration 
officials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill 
bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors 
with leading a global war against U.S. interests.But a 
less subtle explanation was offered on Oct. 13 by Defense Secretary 
William Cohen, who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United 
States had been ``going after'' bin Laden and his colleagues.``We 
weren't quite successful,'' Cohen continued, ``but we sent a message.'' 
Last spring, officials 
said, U.S. intelligence considered a daring raid into Afghanistan 
to capture the Saudi exile.That review, officials said, 
provided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the 
meeting at which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would 
be gathered.While it is, on its face, a sweeping and unqualified 
ban, it has been subject to interpretation and intense debate over 
the years.Striking almost bureaucratic tones, he said 
he was worried that ``an important man with close links'' to bin Laden, 
seemed to have ``fallen into the enemy's hands.''He said the Americans 
were breathing down the necks of his associates in Nairobi and that 
he had to take precautions.He remains a fugitive.The government has asserted that one of Fazil's duties was to prepare 
and transmit reports to bin Laden and his top lieutenants.He has denied any connection 
to terrorist activities.Its author wrote that his mother has 
fallen ill, and that he would like to return to his homeland for a 
visit.He repeatedly 
expressed his fears of American intelligence, which he believed was 
in the midst of a worldwide search for bin Laden and his associates. 
``There is a war and the situation is dangerous,'' he said.One of his senior 
aides who has been talking to U.S. investigators for two years.Bin Laden, a Saudi exile, is 
thought to be living in Afghanistan.``An important man with close 
links to'' bin Laden ``seems to have fallen into the enemy's hands, 
and we have to take all the appropriate security precautions against 
that,'' the operative, Haroun Fazil, wrote in his summary of security 
concerns.There is no indication that the source 
has yet been sentenced and it seems likely that sentencing would take 
place after the investigation and ensuing trials are complete.Tayyib's whereabouts are unknown and he could not 
be reached for comment. 
","The magazine said much of it was based on the testimony of 
an FBI informant, a former bin Laden associate, who made only vague 
connections between Salim and terrorist activities.``America fears its shadow ... in every 
part of the world it is afraid and sees every danger connected to 
bin Laden,'' he said in an interview in the Afghan capital of Kabul. 
Saqib said his inquiry will 
wind up on Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence against bin Laden the 
case will be closed _ at least for the Taliban.The official, 
who could not be further identified, said the questioning was aimed 
at gathering recorded testimony to be used by the prosecution in the 
pre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection 
with the attack.U.S. law provides for the trial 
in the United States of those charged in terror attacks against American 
citizens, even if carried out on foreign soil. 
 
The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania 
and Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he 
has lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban 
militia.The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, 
on Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama 
bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States.The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political 
activity is banned and he has agreed to respect that, the Taliban 
information minister said in a statement Friday.Kader claimed 
during the trial that he had visited Albania to recruit and arm fighters 
for Kosovo, and that four of his associates were still at large.Bin 
Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in 1994 
after telling the government that he was head of a wealthy Saudi humanitarian 
agency wishing to help in Albania, the newspaper reported. 
 
This evidence was uncovered after 
the United States destroyed Idris' factory in a missile attack following 
the bombing of the U.S. embassies, the officials said.In a statement provided 
by Tim Pendry, his London-based adviser, Idris said: ``I have absolutely 
no relationship with any Islamic terrorist organization anywhere in 
the world.U.S. officials 
say they have also received new reports of an increase in the Iraqi 
presence in Sudan since the missile attack.Some State Department and CIA 
officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based 
on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden. 
The criticism is also based on the suspicion that the United States 
has poor data on Sudan, as the CIA station there has been closed since 
1995 and the entire U.S. Embassy since 1996.That year 
a second informer warned of several terrorist threats, including one 
against Anthony Lake, then the national security adviser, but his 
reports proved impossible to confirm.Senior administration officials 
say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence 
of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, 
but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. 
One of the clear but unstated objectives of last August's raid on 
Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and as many of his lieutenants 
as possible, administration officials now acknowledge.According to 
the officials, White House lawyers conducted a secret review in the 
months before the attack and concluded that such operations are legal 
under U.S. and international law.The officials said the raid was 
timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps 
at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would 
be meeting there with his chief operatives.But officials said the White House legal opinion 
drafted before the Afghan strike asserts that the president has authority

disrupt the training, organization and infrastructure of the bin Laden 
terrorist network at the Khost camps,'' said David C. Leavy, a spokesman 
for the National Security Council at the White House.U.S. intelligence officials say they now believe that 
bin Laden was in the camp on the day of the attack, but he appears 
to have left unscathed before the missiles hit.Officials said there 
were reports that at least one of his senior lieutenants may have 
died in the attack, and that total casualties in the complex were 
between 50 and 100.Administration spokesmen have drawn a distinction 
between attempting to kill a specific person like bin Laden and attacking 
a group of people who command a terrorist organization.Administration 
officials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill 
bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors 
with leading a global war against U.S. interests.But a 
less subtle explanation was offered on Oct. 13 by Defense Secretary 
William Cohen, who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United 
States had been ``going after'' bin Laden and his colleagues.The Los Angeles Times recently reported 
that the administration believed that it had a legal right to use 
deadly force against terrorist leaders.Officials said that at roughly the same 
time, the White House drafted the legal justification for military 
attacks against a terrorist leadership.That review, officials said, 
provided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the 
meeting at which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would 
be gathered.The organization,

for many of the significant charges in the indictment against bin

on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and that he attempted to obtain nuclear

African operative wrote in a report apparently intended for the group's 
commanders, ``almost made me explode.``An important man with close

U.S. embassies in East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said an

sources, the camps were being used to train members of bin Laden's 
al Qaeda terrorist group.The Taliban have refused

The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a 
Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month 
to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind 
of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, according to 
U.S. intelligence officials.The evidence, the officials said last 
week, shows that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical 
plant in Khartoum, has had financial dealings with members of Islamic 
Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination there 
of President Anwar Sadat in 1981.This evidence was uncovered after

Police seized copies of the newspaper 
for reproducing a foreign newspaper interview of Afghanistan-based 
Saudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden, who has been accused by the United 
States of masterminding bombing attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya 
and Tanzania in August.The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania 
and Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he 
has lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban 
militia.Albania says it has uncovered a terrorist network operated by Osama 
Bin Laden, the Islamic fundamentalist accused of masterminding the 
August embassy bombings in Africa, and that it's members have infiltrated 
other parts of Europe, The Sunday Times reported.The newspaper quoted 
Fatos Klosi, the head of Shik, the Albanian intelligence service, 
as saying that Bin Laden's network had sent units to fight in Kosovo, 
the neighboring Serbian province.He 
said he believed terrorists had already infiltrated other parts of 
Europe from bases in Albania through a traffic in illegal immigrants, 
who have been smuggled across the Mediterranean to Italy in huge numbers. 
Apparent confirmation 
of the Bin Laden's activities came earlier this month during the murder 
trial of Claude Kader, 27, a French national and self-confessed member 
of Bin Laden's Albanian network, the newspaper said.Bin 
Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in 1994 
after telling the government that he was head of a wealthy Saudi humanitarian 
agency wishing to help in Albania, the newspaper reported. 
 
The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a 
Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month 
to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind 
of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, according to 
U.S. intelligence officials.The evidence, the officials said last 
week, shows that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical 
plant in Khartoum, has had financial dealings with members of Islamic 
Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination there 
of President Anwar Sadat in 1981.This evidence was uncovered after 
the United States destroyed Idris' factory in a missile attack following 
the bombing of the U.S. embassies, the officials said.But intelligence 
agents previously obtained evidence that the manager of the Shifa 
plant made frequent trips to Iraq, where he visited the head of the 
chemical weapons program.In addition, a soil sample that the CIA 
clandestinely took at the Shifa plant showed the presence of a chemical 
used in the production of VX nerve gas, a process used only by Iraq. 
The criticism is also based on the suspicion that the United States 
has poor data on Sudan, as the CIA station there has been closed since 
1995 and the entire U.S. Embassy since 1996.Senior administration officials 
say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence 
of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, 
but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. 
Officials say U.S. intelligence 
has received reports that Idris launders money for international Islamic 
groups, and that he also has a stake in a company in Sudan that is 
40 percent owned by the Military Industrial Corporation, a government 
entity that the United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons 
development.Bin Laden has helped finance the Military Industrial 
Corp. in his effort to use Sudan as a base for chemical weapons production, 
and talked to Sudanese leaders about testing poisonous gases against 
U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, according to U.S. intelligence.According to 
the officials, White House lawyers conducted a secret review in the 
months before the attack and concluded that such operations are legal 
under U.S. and international law.The officials said the raid was 
timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps 
at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would 
be meeting there with his chief operatives.But officials said the White House legal opinion 
drafted before the Afghan strike asserts that the president has authority 
to target the ``infrastructure'' of terrorist groups that are attacking 
Americans.``As 
we said from the time of the Aug. 20 strike, the objective was to 
disrupt the training, organization and infrastructure of the bin Laden 
terrorist network at the Khost camps,'' said David C. Leavy, a spokesman 
for the National Security Council at the White House.U.S. intelligence officials say they now believe that 
bin Laden was in the camp on the day of the attack, but he appears 
to have left unscathed before the missiles hit.Officials said there 
were reports that at least one of his senior lieutenants may have 
died in the attack, and that total casualties in the complex were 
between 50 and 100.He was worried, 
he wrote in an angry dispatch, about the security of the ``East Africa 
network'' of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of masterminding a 
worldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans.The writer, who 
federal authorities believe was Haroun Fazil, who was to become one 
of the central suspects in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi 
a year later, noted with alarm British press reports about the arrest 
of an aide to bin Laden.The letter, an extraordinary bit of digital 
evidence in a cloak-and-dagger case, was retrieved from a computer 
in a house where Fazil had been staying, according to papers filed 
in U.S. District Court in New York City.The documents did not make clear whether 
the FBI had translated and read the document before or after the bombings 
of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 
7 of this year.The timing is potentially important because there 
have been mounting questions since the bombings about whether the 
United States adequately followed up warnings of a possible terrorist 
attack on American targets in Kenya.Officials of the FBI and the 
U.S. attorney's office in New York City refused to say Tuesday night 
at what point FBI agents learned of the computer file, nor would they 
make any other comment.Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document 
seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against 
bin Laden: That he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that 
his operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin Laden's 
door by federal authorities _He said his comrades in East 
Africa ``should know that there is an American-Kenyan-Egyptian intelligence 
activity in Nairobi aiming to identify the names and residences of 
the members who are associated with the sheik since America knows 
well that the youth who lived in Somalia and were members of the sheik's 
cell are the ones who killed Americans in Somalia.''Federal 
authorities said that Khalid al Fawwaz, a London-based associate of 
bin Laden, directed Fazil to ``report periodically to bin Laden about 
the ``security'' situation of the cell.A translation of the report was part of a 
package of documents American prosecutors have sent to Britain to 
support the extradition of Fawwaz for trial in New York.The author noted with alarm a recent 
CIA operation in which a man accused of shooting agency employees 
had been lured across the border in Pakistan and returned to the United 
States for trial.He said that 
the group did not have to inform its Nairobi-based operatives of all 
its global plans, but they needed enough warning to go ``underground 
for a while'' if authorities intensified the pressure in Nairobi. 
If Osama bin Laden ever stands trial in New York for the bombings 
of the U.S. embassies in Africa and other acts of terror, it is already 
clear who prosecutors will call as a chief witness:The 
government has identified the aide in court papers with the pseudonym 
CS-1, saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret 
proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan.According to the government, 
the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period 
when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere.From the court papers filed 
in the investigation of the embassy bombings in East Africa in August, 
it is clear that the informant has provided crucial information to 
federal investigators.They have cited the source in the papers filed 
to support the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who are 
under arrest in Germany and Britain.The source is also the basis 
for many of the significant charges in the indictment against bin 
Laden himself, including the assertion that he directed the attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and that he attempted to obtain nuclear 
weapons.But at least one operative 
of bin Laden's group in East Africa concluded more than a year ago 
that he knew the identity of a crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, a businessman 
who was married to one of bin Laden's relatives.``An important man with close 
links to'' bin Laden ``seems to have fallen into the enemy's hands, 
and we have to take all the appropriate security precautions against 
that,'' the operative, Haroun Fazil, wrote in his summary of security 
concerns.In one recent filing, they said their case 
will in part be ``based on the testimony'' of the confidential source, 
suggesting that the informant has agreed to testify at any trial of 
bin Laden or his associates.In 
the affidavit prepared last week, the source acknowledged pleading 
guilty to terrorism charges in the United States and said they stemmed 
from attacks on U.S. targets, which were not specifically identified. 
","``America is looking for an excuse to fire 
more rockets on our dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden,'' 
Saqib said.Saqib, who heads a judicial inquiry established by the Taliban to 
investigate the terrorism charges against bin Laden, says the United 
States has become insecure.``America fears its shadow ... in every 
part of the world it is afraid and sees every danger connected to 
bin Laden,'' he said in an interview in the Afghan capital of Kabul. 
The Taliban have refused 
to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there 
is evidence they will try him under Islamic law.Saqib said his inquiry will 
wind up on Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence against bin Laden the 
case will be closed _ at least for the Taliban.``Bin Laden is not 
a sinful man ...America has been silent ... they have given no evidence,'' 
he said.``It is too shameful for America who is now seen by all that 
world to have no reason to go after bin Laden.''The official, 
who could not be further identified, said the questioning was aimed 
at gathering recorded testimony to be used by the prosecution in the 
pre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection 
with the attack.Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the 
alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to attack U.S. targets around the 
world, and Muhammad Atef, the alleged military commander of bin Laden's 
terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, were charged in a separate 238-page 
indictment with murder and conspiracy in the bombings.Bin Laden is 
believed to be living in Afghanistan.The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania 
and Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he 
has lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban 
militia.The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political 
activity is banned and he has agreed to respect that, the Taliban 
information minister said in a statement Friday.The minister, Amir 
Khan Muttaqi, also disputed U.S. assertions that bin Laden is a rich 
man, saying the Saudi dissident has had his foreign assets frozen, 
a claim not immediately corroborated. 
 
He 
said he believed terrorists had already infiltrated other parts of 
Europe from bases in Albania through a traffic in illegal immigrants, 
who have been smuggled across the Mediterranean to Italy in huge numbers. 
Kader claimed 
during the trial that he had visited Albania to recruit and arm fighters 
for Kosovo, and that four of his associates were still at large.Bin 
Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in 1994 
after telling the government that he was head of a wealthy Saudi humanitarian 
agency wishing to help in Albania, the newspaper reported. 
 
A spokesman 
for Idris denied the accusations, saying Idris had no ties either 
to bin Laden or to any Islamic terrorist groups.I have never met Mr. bin Laden, I have never spoken with 
him, I have never had any financial or business relationship with 
him, nor knowingly with anyone acting as his agent.''Some State Department and CIA 
officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based 
on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden. 
Senior administration officials 
say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence 
of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, 
but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. 
Officials say U.S. intelligence 
has received reports that Idris launders money for international Islamic 
groups, and that he also has a stake in a company in Sudan that is 
40 percent owned by the Military Industrial Corporation, a government 
entity that the United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons 
development.But they said that Islamic Jihad had now been consolidated into bin 
Laden's terrorist campaign. 
 
The officials said the raid was 
timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps

officials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill 
bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors 
with leading a global war against U.S. interests.But a 
less subtle explanation was offered on Oct. 13 by Defense Secretary 
William Cohen, who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United 
States had been ``going after'' bin Laden and his colleagues.That review, officials said, 
provided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the 
meeting at which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would 
be gathered.He was worried,

he was worried that ``an important man with close links'' to bin Laden, 
seemed to have ``fallen into the enemy's hands.''He said the Americans 
were breathing down the necks of his associates in Nairobi and that 
he had to take precautions.He refers to himself as the media information officer of the East 
Africa cell and complains that he is not being kept in the loop on

the ``security'' situation of the cell.Its author wrote that his mother has 
fallen ill, and that he would like to return to his homeland for a

has poor data on Sudan, as the CIA station there has been closed since 
1995 and the entire U.S. Embassy since 1996.Senior administration officials 
say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence 
of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, 
but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. 
Officials say U.S. intelligence 
has received reports that Idris launders money for international Islamic 
groups, and that he also has a stake in a company in Sudan that is 
40 percent owned by the Military Industrial Corporation, a government 
entity that the United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons 
development.One of the clear but unstated objectives of last August's raid on 
Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and as many of his lieutenants 
as possible, administration officials now acknowledge.The officials said the raid was 
timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps 
at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would 
be meeting there with his chief operatives.But officials said the White House legal opinion 
drafted before the Afghan strike asserts that the president has authority 
to target the ``infrastructure'' of terrorist groups that are attacking 
Americans.``As 
we said from the time of the Aug. 20 strike, the objective was to 
disrupt the training, organization and infrastructure of the bin Laden 
terrorist network at the Khost camps,'' said David C. Leavy, a spokesman 
for the National Security Council at the White House.U.S. intelligence officials say they now believe that 
bin Laden was in the camp on the day of the attack, but he appears 
to have left unscathed before the missiles hit.Officials said there 
were reports that at least one of his senior lieutenants may have 
died in the attack, and that total casualties in the complex were 
between 50 and 100.That review, officials said, 
provided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the 
meeting at which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would 
be gathered.He was worried, 
he wrote in an angry dispatch, about the security of the ``East Africa 
network'' of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of masterminding a 
worldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans.The writer, who 
federal authorities believe was Haroun Fazil, who was to become one 
of the central suspects in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi 
a year later, noted with alarm British press reports about the arrest 
of an aide to bin Laden.He said the Americans 
were breathing down the necks of his associates in Nairobi and that 
he had to take precautions.The documents did not make clear whether 
the FBI had translated and read the document before or after the bombings 
of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 
7 of this year.Fazil eluded American investigators after 
the bombing as he traveled from Kenya to his home in the Comoros Islands 
and then to the Middle East.He refers to himself as the media information officer of the East 
Africa cell and complains that he is not being kept in the loop on 
big decisions.Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document 
seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against 
bin Laden: That he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that 
his operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin Laden's 
door by federal authorities _The writer of the document warned that the 
followers of bin Laden, whom he referred to as ``the sheik,'' had 
``become America's primary target.''He said his comrades in East 
Africa ``should know that there is an American-Kenyan-Egyptian intelligence 
activity in Nairobi aiming to identify the names and residences of 
the members who are associated with the sheik since America knows 
well that the youth who lived in Somalia and were members of the sheik's 
cell are the ones who killed Americans in Somalia.''Federal 
authorities said that Khalid al Fawwaz, a London-based associate of 
bin Laden, directed Fazil to ``report periodically to bin Laden about 
the ``security'' situation of the cell.A translation of the report was part of a 
package of documents American prosecutors have sent to Britain to 
support the extradition of Fawwaz for trial in New York.It is not 
clear from the materials whether the report in the computer was forwarded 
to bin Laden.The author noted with alarm a recent 
CIA operation in which a man accused of shooting agency employees 
had been lured across the border in Pakistan and returned to the United 
States for trial.If Osama bin Laden ever stands trial in New York for the bombings 
of the U.S. embassies in Africa and other acts of terror, it is already 
clear who prosecutors will call as a chief witness:The 
government has identified the aide in court papers with the pseudonym 
CS-1, saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret 
proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan.According to the government, 
the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period 
when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere.From the court papers filed 
in the investigation of the embassy bombings in East Africa in August, 
it is clear that the informant has provided crucial information to 
federal investigators.They have cited the source in the papers filed 
to support the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who are 
under arrest in Germany and Britain.The source is also the basis 
for many of the significant charges in the indictment against bin 
Laden himself, including the assertion that he directed the attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and that he attempted to obtain nuclear 
weapons.But at least one operative 
of bin Laden's group in East Africa concluded more than a year ago 
that he knew the identity of a crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, a businessman 
who was married to one of bin Laden's relatives.``An important man with close 
links to'' bin Laden ``seems to have fallen into the enemy's hands, 
and we have to take all the appropriate security precautions against 
that,'' the operative, Haroun Fazil, wrote in his summary of security 
concerns.In one recent filing, they said their case 
will in part be ``based on the testimony'' of the confidential source, 
suggesting that the informant has agreed to testify at any trial of 
bin Laden or his associates.In 
the affidavit prepared last week, the source acknowledged pleading 
guilty to terrorism charges in the United States and said they stemmed 
from attacks on U.S. targets, which were not specifically identified. 
","U.S. prosecutors have asked for a 20-day extension 
to provide Germany with paperwork necessary to extradite a top lieutenant 
of Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden, officials said Saturday. 
``America is looking for an excuse to fire 
more rockets on our dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden,'' 
Saqib said.The Taliban have refused 
to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there 
is evidence they will try him under Islamic law.Saqib said his inquiry will 
wind up on Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence against bin Laden the 
case will be closed _ at least for the Taliban.America has been silent ... they have given no evidence,'' 
he said.``It is too shameful for America who is now seen by all that 
world to have no reason to go after bin Laden.''Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the 
alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to attack U.S. targets around the 
world, and Muhammad Atef, the alleged military commander of bin Laden's 
terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, were charged in a separate 238-page 
indictment with murder and conspiracy in the bombings.Bin Laden is 
believed to be living in Afghanistan.Police arrested two journalists and charged them with writing articles 
to encourage Muslim youths to stage an Islamic revolution in Bangladesh 
after the Taliban model in Afghanistan, a police officer said Thursday. 
Mufti Abdul Hye and Manzoor Ahmed, editors at ``Jago Mujahid'' or 
``Wake Up Mujahid,'' a monthy magazine published from Dhaka, the Bangladeshi 
capital, were jailed for a month shortly after their arrest on Wednesday. 
Men must grow beards of a certain length and criminals 
are subjected to amputations and public executions Even though Bangladesh 
is a predominantly Muslim country, it is governed by secular laws. 
The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania 
and Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he 
has lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban 
militia.The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, 
on Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama 
bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States.``It's 
over, and America has not presented any evidence,'' Afghanistan's 
chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press in an 
interview at the Supreme Court building in the Afghan capital, Kabul. 
The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political 
activity is banned and he has agreed to respect that, the Taliban 
information minister said in a statement Friday.The minister, Amir 
Khan Muttaqi, also disputed U.S. assertions that bin Laden is a rich 
man, saying the Saudi dissident has had his foreign assets frozen, 
a claim not immediately corroborated. 
 
Albania says it has uncovered a terrorist network operated by Osama 
Bin Laden, the Islamic fundamentalist accused of masterminding the 
August embassy bombings in Africa, and that it's members have infiltrated 
other parts of Europe, The Sunday Times reported.He 
said he believed terrorists had already infiltrated other parts of 
Europe from bases in Albania through a traffic in illegal immigrants, 
who have been smuggled across the Mediterranean to Italy in huge numbers. 
Kader claimed 
during the trial that he had visited Albania to recruit and arm fighters 
for Kosovo, and that four of his associates were still at large.Bin 
Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in 1994 
after telling the government that he was head of a wealthy Saudi humanitarian 
agency wishing to help in Albania, the newspaper reported. 
 
The evidence, the officials said last 
week, shows that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical 
plant in Khartoum, has had financial dealings with members of Islamic 
Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination there 
of President Anwar Sadat in 1981.A spokesman 
for Idris denied the accusations, saying Idris had no ties either 
to bin Laden or to any Islamic terrorist groups.In a statement provided 
by Tim Pendry, his London-based adviser, Idris said: ``I have absolutely 
no relationship with any Islamic terrorist organization anywhere in 
the world.I have never met Mr. bin Laden, I have never spoken with 
him, I have never had any financial or business relationship with 
him, nor knowingly with anyone acting as his agent.''Some State Department and CIA 
officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based 
on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden. 
Senior administration officials 
say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence 
of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, 
but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. 
Officials say U.S. intelligence 
has received reports that Idris launders money for international Islamic 
groups, and that he also has a stake in a company in Sudan that is 
40 percent owned by the Military Industrial Corporation, a government 
entity that the United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons 
development.Bin Laden has helped finance the Military Industrial 
Corp. in his effort to use Sudan as a base for chemical weapons production, 
and talked to Sudanese leaders about testing poisonous gases against 
U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, according to U.S. intelligence.But they said that Islamic Jihad had now been consolidated into bin 
Laden's terrorist campaign. 
 
One of the clear but unstated objectives of last August's raid on 
Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and as many of his lieutenants 
as possible, administration officials now acknowledge.The officials said the raid was 
timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps 
at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would 
be meeting there with his chief operatives.Administration spokesmen have drawn a distinction 
between attempting to kill a specific person like bin Laden and attacking 
a group of people who command a terrorist organization.Administration 
officials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill 
bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors 
with leading a global war against U.S. interests.But a 
less subtle explanation was offered on Oct. 13 by Defense Secretary 
William Cohen, who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United 
States had been ``going after'' bin Laden and his colleagues.That review, officials said, 
provided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the 
meeting at which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would 
be gathered.Striking almost bureaucratic tones, he said 
he was worried that ``an important man with close links'' to bin Laden, 
seemed to have ``fallen into the enemy's hands.''Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document

and transmit reports to bin Laden and his top lieutenants.Federal 
authorities said that Khalid al Fawwaz, a London-based associate of 
bin Laden, directed Fazil to ``report periodically to bin Laden about 
the ``security'' situation of the cell.Its author wrote that his mother has 
fallen ill, and that he would like to return to his homeland for a 
visit.He repeatedly 
expressed his fears of American intelligence, which he believed was 
in the midst of a worldwide search for bin Laden and his associates. 
He said that 
the group did not have to inform its Nairobi-based operatives of all 
its global plans, but they needed enough warning to go ``underground 
for a while'' if authorities intensified the pressure in Nairobi. 
According to the government, 
the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period 
when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere.Bin Laden, a Saudi exile, is

provided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the 
meeting at which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would 
be gathered.He was worried, 
he wrote in an angry dispatch, about the security of the ``East Africa 
network'' of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of masterminding a 
worldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans.The writer, who 
federal authorities believe was Haroun Fazil, who was to become one 
of the central suspects in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi 
a year later, noted with alarm British press reports about the arrest 
of an aide to bin Laden.He said the Americans 
were breathing down the necks of his associates in Nairobi and that 
he had to take precautions.The letter, an extraordinary bit of digital 
evidence in a cloak-and-dagger case, was retrieved from a computer 
in a house where Fazil had been staying, according to papers filed 
in U.S. District Court in New York City.The documents did not make clear whether 
the FBI had translated and read the document before or after the bombings 
of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 
7 of this year.The timing is potentially important because there 
have been mounting questions since the bombings about whether the 
United States adequately followed up warnings of a possible terrorist 
attack on American targets in Kenya.Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document 
seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against 
bin Laden: That he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that 
his operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin Laden's 
door by federal authorities _He said his comrades in East 
Africa ``should know that there is an American-Kenyan-Egyptian intelligence 
activity in Nairobi aiming to identify the names and residences of 
the members who are associated with the sheik since America knows 
well that the youth who lived in Somalia and were members of the sheik's 
cell are the ones who killed Americans in Somalia.''Federal 
authorities said that Khalid al Fawwaz, a London-based associate of 
bin Laden, directed Fazil to ``report periodically to bin Laden about 
the ``security'' situation of the cell.A translation of the report was part of a 
package of documents American prosecutors have sent to Britain to 
support the extradition of Fawwaz for trial in New York.He repeatedly 
expressed his fears of American intelligence, which he believed was 
in the midst of a worldwide search for bin Laden and his associates. 
He said that 
the group did not have to inform its Nairobi-based operatives of all 
its global plans, but they needed enough warning to go ``underground 
for a while'' if authorities intensified the pressure in Nairobi. 
If Osama bin Laden ever stands trial in New York for the bombings 
of the U.S. embassies in Africa and other acts of terror, it is already 
clear who prosecutors will call as a chief witness:The 
government has identified the aide in court papers with the pseudonym 
CS-1, saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret 
proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan.According to the government, 
the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period 
when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere.From the court papers filed 
in the investigation of the embassy bombings in East Africa in August, 
it is clear that the informant has provided crucial information to 
federal investigators.They have cited the source in the papers filed 
to support the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who are 
under arrest in Germany and Britain.The source is also the basis 
for many of the significant charges in the indictment against bin 
Laden himself, including the assertion that he directed the attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and that he attempted to obtain nuclear 
weapons.But at least one operative 
of bin Laden's group in East Africa concluded more than a year ago 
that he knew the identity of a crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, a businessman 
who was married to one of bin Laden's relatives.In an August, 1997 article, The Daily 
Telegraph said Tayyib had been in custody in Saudi Arabia since May 
and had given intelligence officials details of bin Laden's bank accounts 
and businesses.``An important man with close 
links to'' bin Laden ``seems to have fallen into the enemy's hands, 
and we have to take all the appropriate security precautions against 
that,'' the operative, Haroun Fazil, wrote in his summary of security 
concerns.In one recent filing, they said their case 
will in part be ``based on the testimony'' of the confidential source, 
suggesting that the informant has agreed to testify at any trial of 
bin Laden or his associates.In 
the affidavit prepared last week, the source acknowledged pleading 
guilty to terrorism charges in the United States and said they stemmed 
from attacks on U.S. targets, which were not specifically identified. 
","U.S. prosecutors have asked for a 20-day extension 
to provide Germany with paperwork necessary to extradite a top lieutenant 
of Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden, officials said Saturday. 
``America is looking for an excuse to fire 
more rockets on our dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden,'' 
Saqib said.Washington, which has posted a dlrs 5 million reward for 
bin Laden's arrest, hasn't ruled out further attacks on Afghanistan. 
In Afghanistan, bin Laden is considered an honored guest by his Taliban 
hosts.So far Saqib says he has no evidence of bin 
Laden's involvement in terrorist activities.The Taliban have refused 
to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there 
is evidence they will try him under Islamic law.``We want good relations 
with the United States and all Muslim and non-Muslim countries, but 
they have to respect our ways,'' he said.Saqib said his inquiry will 
wind up on Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence against bin Laden the 
case will be closed _ at least for the Taliban.``Bin Laden is not 
a sinful man ...America has been silent ... they have given no evidence,'' 
he said.``It is too shameful for America who is now seen by all that 
world to have no reason to go after bin Laden.''Bin Laden is 
believed to be living in Afghanistan.They were arrested under a 1974 law that allows police to detain any 
one for offenses related to national security, the officer said on 
condition of anonymity.Those arrested need not be taken to court 
for trial for up to three months.Men must grow beards of a certain length and criminals 
are subjected to amputations and public executions Even though Bangladesh 
is a predominantly Muslim country, it is governed by secular laws. 
``Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin. ...He is 
a free man.''The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political 
activity is banned and he has agreed to respect that, the Taliban 
information minister said in a statement Friday.The minister, Amir 
Khan Muttaqi, also disputed U.S. assertions that bin Laden is a rich 
man, saying the Saudi dissident has had his foreign assets frozen, 
a claim not immediately corroborated. 
 
Kader claimed 
during the trial that he had visited Albania to recruit and arm fighters 
for Kosovo, and that four of his associates were still at large.Bin 
Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in 1994 
after telling the government that he was head of a wealthy Saudi humanitarian 
agency wishing to help in Albania, the newspaper reported. 
 
Islamic Jihad, in turn, receives 
money and sponsorship from bin Laden and has been absorbed into his 
terror network, the officials added.A spokesman 
for Idris denied the accusations, saying Idris had no ties either 
to bin Laden or to any Islamic terrorist groups.In a statement provided 
by Tim Pendry, his London-based adviser, Idris said: ``I have absolutely 
no relationship with any Islamic terrorist organization anywhere in 
the world.I have never met Mr. bin Laden, I have never spoken with 
him, I have never had any financial or business relationship with 
him, nor knowingly with anyone acting as his agent.''Officials said they were 
not certain what the Iraqis were now doing in Khartoum.Some State Department and CIA 
officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based 
on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden. 
``What we knew about the ownership was that 
a lot of it couldn't be reliably established,'' said one senior U.S. 
intelligence official.But Pendry 
denied that Idris owned any businesses withBut they said that Islamic Jihad had now been consolidated into bin 
Laden's terrorist campaign. 
 
The officials said the raid was 
timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps 
at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would 
be meeting there with his chief operatives.Senior administration officials said they never 
discussed killing bin Laden in their planning sessions.Administration 
officials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill 
bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors 
with leading a global war against U.S. interests.But a 
less subtle explanation was offered on Oct. 13 by Defense Secretary 
William Cohen, who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United 
States had been ``going after'' bin Laden and his colleagues.Last spring, officials 
said, U.S. intelligence considered a daring raid into Afghanistan 
to capture the Saudi exile.That review, officials said, 
provided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the 
meeting at which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would 
be gathered.While it is, on its face, a sweeping and unqualified 
ban, it has been subject to interpretation and intense debate over 
the years.Striking almost bureaucratic tones, he said 
he was worried that ``an important man with close links'' to bin Laden, 
seemed to have ``fallen into the enemy's hands.''He said the Americans 
were breathing down the necks of his associates in Nairobi and that 
he had to take precautions.The government has asserted that one of Fazil's duties was to prepare 
and transmit reports to bin Laden and his top lieutenants.He has denied any connection 
to terrorist activities.Its author wrote that his mother has 
fallen ill, and that he would like to return to his homeland for a 
visit.He repeatedly 
expressed his fears of American intelligence, which he believed was 
in the midst of a worldwide search for bin Laden and his associates. 
``There is a war and the situation is dangerous,'' he said.One of his senior 
aides who has been talking to U.S. investigators for two years.Bin Laden, a Saudi exile, is 
thought to be living in Afghanistan.In an August, 1997 article, The Daily

concerns.There is no indication that the source 
has yet been sentenced and it seems likely that sentencing would take 
place after the investigation and ensuing trials are complete.Tayyib's whereabouts are unknown and he could not 
be reached for comment. 
","And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, the man 
Washington calls Enemy No. 1 and blames for the Aug. 7 bombings of 
U.S. embassies in East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said an 
interview with The Associated Press.According to U.S. intelligence 
sources, the camps were being used to train members of bin Laden's 
al Qaeda terrorist group.``America is looking for an excuse to fire 
more rockets on our dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden,'' 
Saqib said.In Afghanistan, bin Laden is considered an honored guest by his Taliban

pre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection 
with the attack.Bin Laden is

Senior administration officials 
say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence 
of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, 
but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. 
``What we knew about the ownership was that 
a lot of it couldn't be reliably established,'' said one senior U.S. 
intelligence official.Officials say U.S. intelligence 
has received reports that Idris launders money for international Islamic 
groups, and that he also has a stake in a company in Sudan that is 
40 percent owned by the Military Industrial Corporation, a government 
entity that the United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons 
development.But they said that Islamic Jihad had now been consolidated into bin 
Laden's terrorist campaign.

bin Laden was in the camp on the day of the attack, but he appears 
to have left unscathed before the missiles hit.Officials said there 
were reports that at least one of his senior lieutenants may have 
died in the attack, and that total casualties in the complex were 
between 50 and 100.Administration

The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a 
Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month 
to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind 
of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, according to 
U.S. intelligence officials.The evidence, the officials said last 
week, shows that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical 
plant in Khartoum, has had financial dealings with members of Islamic 
Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination there 
of President Anwar Sadat in 1981.This evidence was uncovered after 
the United States destroyed Idris' factory in a missile attack following 
the bombing of the U.S. embassies, the officials said.U.S. officials 
say they have also received new reports of an increase in the Iraqi 
presence in Sudan since the missile attack.The criticism is also based on the suspicion that the United States 
has poor data on Sudan, as the CIA station there has been closed since 
1995 and the entire U.S. Embassy since 1996.Senior administration officials

Europe from bases in Albania through a traffic in illegal immigrants, 
who have been smuggled across the Mediterranean to Italy in huge numbers. 
Apparent confirmation 
of the Bin Laden's activities came earlier this month during the murder 
trial of Claude Kader, 27, a French national and self-confessed member 
of Bin Laden's Albanian network, the newspaper said.Bin 
Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in 1994 
after telling the government that he was head of a wealthy Saudi humanitarian 
agency wishing to help in Albania, the newspaper reported. 
 
The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a 
Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month 
to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind 
of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, according to 
U.S. intelligence officials.The evidence, the officials said last 
week, shows that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical 
plant in Khartoum, has had financial dealings with members of Islamic 
Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination there 
of President Anwar Sadat in 1981.I have never met Mr. bin Laden, I have never spoken with 
him, I have never had any financial or business relationship with 
him, nor knowingly with anyone acting as his agent.''Some State Department and CIA 
officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based 
on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden. 
Senior administration officials 
say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence 
of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, 
but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. 
Officials say U.S. intelligence 
has received reports that Idris launders money for international Islamic 
groups, and that he also has a stake in a company in Sudan that is 
40 percent owned by the Military Industrial Corporation, a government 
entity that the United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons 
development.Bin Laden has helped finance the Military Industrial 
Corp. in his effort to use Sudan as a base for chemical weapons production, 
and talked to Sudanese leaders about testing poisonous gases against 
U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, according to U.S. intelligence.One of the clear but unstated objectives of last August's raid on 
Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and as many of his lieutenants 
as possible, administration officials now acknowledge.The officials said the raid was 
timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps 
at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would 
be meeting there with his chief operatives.But officials said the White House legal opinion 
drafted before the Afghan strike asserts that the president has authority 
to target the ``infrastructure'' of terrorist groups that are attacking 
Americans.``As 
we said from the time of the Aug. 20 strike, the objective was to 
disrupt the training, organization and infrastructure of the bin Laden 
terrorist network at the Khost camps,'' said David C. Leavy, a spokesman 
for the National Security Council at the White House.U.S. intelligence officials say they now believe that 
bin Laden was in the camp on the day of the attack, but he appears 
to have left unscathed before the missiles hit.Officials said there 
were reports that at least one of his senior lieutenants may have 
died in the attack, and that total casualties in the complex were 
between 50 and 100.Administration 
officials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill 
bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors 
with leading a global war against U.S. interests.But a 
less subtle explanation was offered on Oct. 13 by Defense Secretary 
William Cohen, who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United 
States had been ``going after'' bin Laden and his colleagues.That review, officials said, 
provided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the 
meeting at which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would 
be gathered.He was worried, 
he wrote in an angry dispatch, about the security of the ``East Africa 
network'' of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of masterminding a 
worldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans.The writer, who 
federal authorities believe was Haroun Fazil, who was to become one 
of the central suspects in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi 
a year later, noted with alarm British press reports about the arrest 
of an aide to bin Laden.Striking almost bureaucratic tones, he said 
he was worried that ``an important man with close links'' to bin Laden, 
seemed to have ``fallen into the enemy's hands.''Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document 
seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against 
bin Laden: That he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that 
his operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin Laden's 
door by federal authorities _He said his comrades in East 
Africa ``should know that there is an American-Kenyan-Egyptian intelligence 
activity in Nairobi aiming to identify the names and residences of 
the members who are associated with the sheik since America knows 
well that the youth who lived in Somalia and were members of the sheik's 
cell are the ones who killed Americans in Somalia.''Federal 
authorities said that Khalid al Fawwaz, a London-based associate of 
bin Laden, directed Fazil to ``report periodically to bin Laden about 
the ``security'' situation of the cell.He repeatedly 
expressed his fears of American intelligence, which he believed was 
in the midst of a worldwide search for bin Laden and his associates. 
The author noted with alarm a recent 
CIA operation in which a man accused of shooting agency employees 
had been lured across the border in Pakistan and returned to the United 
States for trial.He said that 
the group did not have to inform its Nairobi-based operatives of all 
its global plans, but they needed enough warning to go ``underground 
for a while'' if authorities intensified the pressure in Nairobi. 
According to the government, 
the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period 
when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere.They have cited the source in the papers filed 
to support the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who are 
under arrest in Germany and Britain.The source is also the basis 
for many of the significant charges in the indictment against bin 
Laden himself, including the assertion that he directed the attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and that he attempted to obtain nuclear 
weapons.But at least one operative 
of bin Laden's group in East Africa concluded more than a year ago 
that he knew the identity of a crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, a businessman 
who was married to one of bin Laden's relatives.``An important man with close 
links to'' bin Laden ``seems to have fallen into the enemy's hands, 
and we have to take all the appropriate security precautions against 
that,'' the operative, Haroun Fazil, wrote in his summary of security 
concerns.In one recent filing, they said their case 
will in part be ``based on the testimony'' of the confidential source, 
suggesting that the informant has agreed to testify at any trial of 
bin Laden or his associates.There is no indication that the source 
has yet been sentenced and it seems likely that sentencing would take 
place after the investigation and ensuing trials are complete.","And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, the man 
Washington calls Enemy No. 1 and blames for the Aug. 7 bombings of 
U.S. embassies in East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said an 
interview with The Associated Press.``America fears its shadow ... in every 
part of the world it is afraid and sees every danger connected to 
bin Laden,'' he said in an interview in the Afghan capital of Kabul. 
FBI agents this week began questioning relatives 
of the victims of the Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombing as well as the seriously 
injured on request of the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern 
District of New York, a U.S. official said Thursday.The official, 
who could not be further identified, said the questioning was aimed 
at gathering recorded testimony to be used by the prosecution in the 
pre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection 
with the attack.Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the 
alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to attack U.S. targets around the 
world, and Muhammad Atef, the alleged military commander of bin Laden's 
terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, were charged in a separate 238-page 
indictment with murder and conspiracy in the bombings.Police arrested two journalists and charged them with writing articles 
to encourage Muslim youths to stage an Islamic revolution in Bangladesh 
after the Taliban model in Afghanistan, a police officer said Thursday. 
Police seized copies of the newspaper 
for reproducing a foreign newspaper interview of Afghanistan-based 
Saudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden, who has been accused by the United 
States of masterminding bombing attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya 
and Tanzania in August.The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania 
and Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he 
has lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban 
militia.Albania says it has uncovered a terrorist network operated by Osama 
Bin Laden, the Islamic fundamentalist accused of masterminding the 
August embassy bombings in Africa, and that it's members have infiltrated 
other parts of Europe, The Sunday Times reported.The newspaper quoted 
Fatos Klosi, the head of Shik, the Albanian intelligence service, 
as saying that Bin Laden's network had sent units to fight in Kosovo, 
the neighboring Serbian province.He 
said he believed terrorists had already infiltrated other parts of 
Europe from bases in Albania through a traffic in illegal immigrants, 
who have been smuggled across the Mediterranean to Italy in huge numbers.

agents previously obtained evidence that the manager of the Shifa

chemical weapons program.In addition, a soil sample that the CIA 
clandestinely took at the Shifa plant showed the presence of a chemical 
used in the production of VX nerve gas, a process used only by Iraq. 
The criticism is also based on the suspicion that the United States 
has poor data on Sudan, as the CIA station there has been closed since 
1995 and the entire U.S. Embassy since 1996.Senior administration officials 
say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence 
of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program,

months before the attack and concluded that such operations are legal 
under U.S. and international law.The officials said the raid was

evidence in a cloak-and-dagger case, was retrieved from a computer 
in a house where Fazil had been staying, according to papers filed 
in U.S. District Court in New York City.The documents did not make clear whether 
the FBI had translated and read the document before or after the bombings 
of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 
7 of this year.The timing is potentially important because there 
have been mounting questions since the bombings about whether the 
United States adequately followed up warnings of a possible terrorist 
attack on American targets in Kenya.Officials of the FBI and the 
U.S. attorney's office in New York City refused to say Tuesday night 
at what point FBI agents learned of the computer file, nor would they 
make any other comment.Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document 
seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against

of the U.S. embassies in Africa and other acts of terror, it is already 
clear who prosecutors will call as a chief witness:The 
government has identified the aide in court papers with the pseudonym 
CS-1, saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret 
proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan.According to the government, 
the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period

and talked to Sudanese leaders about testing poisonous gases against 
U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, according to U.S. intelligence.But they said that Islamic Jihad had now been consolidated into bin 
Laden's terrorist campaign. 
 
The officials said the raid was 
timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps 
at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would 
be meeting there with his chief operatives.``As 
we said from the time of the Aug. 20 strike, the objective was to 
disrupt the training, organization and infrastructure of the bin Laden 
terrorist network at the Khost camps,'' said David C. Leavy, a spokesman 
for the National Security Council at the White House.U.S. intelligence officials say they now believe that 
bin Laden was in the camp on the day of the attack, but he appears 
to have left unscathed before the missiles hit.Officials said there 
were reports that at least one of his senior lieutenants may have 
died in the attack, and that total casualties in the complex were 
between 50 and 100.Administration 
officials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill 
bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors 
with leading a global war against U.S. interests.But a 
less subtle explanation was offered on Oct. 13 by Defense Secretary 
William Cohen, who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United 
States had been ``going after'' bin Laden and his colleagues.That review, officials said, 
provided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the 
meeting at which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would 
be gathered.He was worried, 
he wrote in an angry dispatch, about the security of the ``East Africa 
network'' of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of masterminding a 
worldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans.The writer, who 
federal authorities believe was Haroun Fazil, who was to become one 
of the central suspects in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi 
a year later, noted with alarm British press reports about the arrest 
of an aide to bin Laden.Striking almost bureaucratic tones, he said 
he was worried that ``an important man with close links'' to bin Laden, 
seemed to have ``fallen into the enemy's hands.''He said the Americans 
were breathing down the necks of his associates in Nairobi and that 
he had to take precautions.He refers to himself as the media information officer of the East 
Africa cell and complains that he is not being kept in the loop on 
big decisions.Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document 
seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against 
bin Laden: That he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that 
his operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin Laden's 
door by federal authorities _He said his comrades in East 
Africa ``should know that there is an American-Kenyan-Egyptian intelligence 
activity in Nairobi aiming to identify the names and residences of 
the members who are associated with the sheik since America knows 
well that the youth who lived in Somalia and were members of the sheik's 
cell are the ones who killed Americans in Somalia.''The government has asserted that one of Fazil's duties was to prepare 
and transmit reports to bin Laden and his top lieutenants.Federal 
authorities said that Khalid al Fawwaz, a London-based associate of 
bin Laden, directed Fazil to ``report periodically to bin Laden about 
the ``security'' situation of the cell.It is not 
clear from the materials whether the report in the computer was forwarded 
to bin Laden.Its author wrote that his mother has 
fallen ill, and that he would like to return to his homeland for a 
visit.He repeatedly 
expressed his fears of American intelligence, which he believed was 
in the midst of a worldwide search for bin Laden and his associates. 
He said that 
the group did not have to inform its Nairobi-based operatives of all 
its global plans, but they needed enough warning to go ``underground 
for a while'' if authorities intensified the pressure in Nairobi. 
According to the government, 
the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period 
when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere.They have cited the source in the papers filed 
to support the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who are 
under arrest in Germany and Britain.Bin Laden, a Saudi exile, is 
thought to be living in Afghanistan.The source is also the basis 
for many of the significant charges in the indictment against bin 
Laden himself, including the assertion that he directed the attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and that he attempted to obtain nuclear 
weapons.But at least one operative 
of bin Laden's group in East Africa concluded more than a year ago 
that he knew the identity of a crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, a businessman 
who was married to one of bin Laden's relatives.``An important man with close 
links to'' bin Laden ``seems to have fallen into the enemy's hands, 
and we have to take all the appropriate security precautions against 
that,'' the operative, Haroun Fazil, wrote in his summary of security 
concerns.In one recent filing, they said their case 
will in part be ``based on the testimony'' of the confidential source, 
suggesting that the informant has agreed to testify at any trial of 
bin Laden or his associates.There is no indication that the source 
has yet been sentenced and it seems likely that sentencing would take 
place after the investigation and ensuing trials are complete.","And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, the man 
Washington calls Enemy No. 1 and blames for the Aug. 7 bombings of 
U.S. embassies in East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said an 
interview with The Associated Press.``America fears its shadow ... in every 
part of the world it is afraid and sees every danger connected to 
bin Laden,'' he said in an interview in the Afghan capital of Kabul. 
The Taliban have refused 
to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there 
is evidence they will try him under Islamic law.Saqib said his inquiry will 
wind up on Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence against bin Laden the 
case will be closed _ at least for the Taliban.``It is too shameful for America who is now seen by all that 
world to have no reason to go after bin Laden.''The official, 
who could not be further identified, said the questioning was aimed 
at gathering recorded testimony to be used by the prosecution in the 
pre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection 
with the attack.Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the 
alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to attack U.S. targets around the 
world, and Muhammad Atef, the alleged military commander of bin Laden's 
terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, were charged in a separate 238-page 
indictment with murder and conspiracy in the bombings.Bin Laden is 
believed to be living in Afghanistan.Police seized copies of the newspaper 
for reproducing a foreign newspaper interview of Afghanistan-based 
Saudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden, who has been accused by the United 
States of masterminding bombing attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya 
and Tanzania in August.The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania 
and Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he 
has lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban 
militia.The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political 
activity is banned and he has agreed to respect that, the Taliban 
information minister said in a statement Friday.Albania says it has uncovered a terrorist network operated by Osama 
Bin Laden, the Islamic fundamentalist accused of masterminding the 
August embassy bombings in Africa, and that it's members have infiltrated 
other parts of Europe, The Sunday Times reported.Bin 
Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in 1994 
after telling the government that he was head of a wealthy Saudi humanitarian 
agency wishing to help in Albania, the newspaper reported. 
 
The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a 
Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month 
to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind 
of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, according to 
U.S. intelligence officials.The evidence, the officials said last 
week, shows that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical 
plant in Khartoum, has had financial dealings with members of Islamic 
Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination there 
of President Anwar Sadat in 1981.Some State Department and CIA 
officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based 
on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden. 
The criticism is also based on the suspicion that the United States 
has poor data on Sudan, as the CIA station there has been closed since 
1995 and the entire U.S. Embassy since 1996.Senior administration officials 
say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence 
of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, 
but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. 
Officials say U.S. intelligence 
has received reports that Idris launders money for international Islamic 
groups, and that he also has a stake in a company in Sudan that is 
40 percent owned by the Military Industrial Corporation, a government 
entity that the United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons 
development.Bin Laden has helped finance the Military Industrial 
Corp. in his effort to use Sudan as a base for chemical weapons production,

had been lured across the border in Pakistan and returned to the United 
States for trial.If Osama bin Laden ever stands trial in New York for the bombings 
of the U.S. embassies in Africa and other acts of terror, it is already 
clear who prosecutors will call as a chief witness:The 
government has identified the aide in court papers with the pseudonym 
CS-1, saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret 
proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan.According to the government,

believed to be living in Afghanistan.Police arrested two journalists and charged them with writing articles 
to encourage Muslim youths to stage an Islamic revolution in Bangladesh 
after the Taliban model in Afghanistan, a police officer said Thursday. 
Police seized copies of the newspaper

Saudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden, who has been accused by the United

is a predominantly Muslim country, it is governed by secular laws. 
The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania

has lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban 
militia.The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, 
on Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama 
bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States.``It's 
over, and America has not presented any evidence,'' Afghanistan's 
chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press in an 
interview at the Supreme Court building in the Afghan capital, Kabul. 
The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political 
activity is banned and he has agreed to respect that, the Taliban 
information minister said in a statement Friday.The minister, Amir 
Khan Muttaqi, also disputed U.S. assertions that bin Laden is a rich 
man, saying the Saudi dissident has had his foreign assets frozen,

Europe from bases in Albania through a traffic in illegal immigrants, 
who have been smuggled across the Mediterranean to Italy in huge numbers.

for Idris denied the accusations, saying Idris had no ties either 
to bin Laden or to any Islamic terrorist groups.In a statement provided 
by Tim Pendry, his London-based adviser, Idris said: ``I have absolutely 
no relationship with any Islamic terrorist organization anywhere in 
the world.I have never met Mr. bin Laden, I have never spoken with 
him, I have never had any financial or business relationship with 
him, nor knowingly with anyone acting as his agent.''Some State Department and CIA

his operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin Laden's 
door by federal authorities _He said his comrades in East 
Africa ``should know that there is an American-Kenyan-Egyptian intelligence 
activity in Nairobi aiming to identify the names and residences of 
the members who are associated with the sheik since America knows 
well that the youth who lived in Somalia and were members of the sheik's 
cell are the ones who killed Americans in Somalia.''The government has asserted that one of Fazil's duties was to prepare 
and transmit reports to bin Laden and his top lieutenants.Its author wrote that his mother has 
fallen ill, and that he would like to return to his homeland for a 
visit.He repeatedly 
expressed his fears of American intelligence, which he believed was 
in the midst of a worldwide search for bin Laden and his associates. 
He said that 
the group did not have to inform its Nairobi-based operatives of all 
its global plans, but they needed enough warning to go ``underground 
for a while'' if authorities intensified the pressure in Nairobi. 
According to the government, 
the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period 
when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere.Bin Laden, a Saudi exile, is 
thought to be living in Afghanistan.The source is also the basis 
for many of the significant charges in the indictment against bin 
Laden himself, including the assertion that he directed the attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and that he attempted to obtain nuclear 
weapons.But at least one operative 
of bin Laden's group in East Africa concluded more than a year ago 
that he knew the identity of a crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, a businessman 
who was married to one of bin Laden's relatives.In an August, 1997 article, The Daily 
Telegraph said Tayyib had been in custody in Saudi Arabia since May 
and had given intelligence officials details of bin Laden's bank accounts 
and businesses.``An important man with close 
links to'' bin Laden ``seems to have fallen into the enemy's hands, 
and we have to take all the appropriate security precautions against 
that,'' the operative, Haroun Fazil, wrote in his summary of security 
concerns.In one recent filing, they said their case 
will in part be ``based on the testimony'' of the confidential source, 
suggesting that the informant has agreed to testify at any trial of 
bin Laden or his associates.There is no indication that the source 
has yet been sentenced and it seems likely that sentencing would take 
place after the investigation and ensuing trials are complete.","U.S. prosecutors have asked for a 20-day extension 
to provide Germany with paperwork necessary to extradite a top lieutenant 
of Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden, officials said Saturday. 
And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, the man 
Washington calls Enemy No. 1 and blames for the Aug. 7 bombings of 
U.S. embassies in East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said an 
interview with The Associated Press.The Taliban have refused 
to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there 
is evidence they will try him under Islamic law.``It is too shameful for America who is now seen by all that 
world to have no reason to go after bin Laden.''The official, 
who could not be further identified, said the questioning was aimed 
at gathering recorded testimony to be used by the prosecution in the 
pre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection 
with the attack.Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the 
alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to attack U.S. targets around the 
world, and Muhammad Atef, the alleged military commander of bin Laden's 
terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, were charged in a separate 238-page 
indictment with murder and conspiracy in the bombings.Bin Laden is 
believed to be living in Afghanistan.Police seized copies of the newspaper 
for reproducing a foreign newspaper interview of Afghanistan-based 
Saudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden, who has been accused by the United 
States of masterminding bombing attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya 
and Tanzania in August.The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania 
and Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he 
has lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban 
militia.The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, 
on Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama 
bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States.The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political 
activity is banned and he has agreed to respect that, the Taliban 
information minister said in a statement Friday.Albania says it has uncovered a terrorist network operated by Osama 
Bin Laden, the Islamic fundamentalist accused of masterminding the 
August embassy bombings in Africa, and that it's members have infiltrated 
other parts of Europe, The Sunday Times reported.Bin 
Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in 1994 
after telling the government that he was head of a wealthy Saudi humanitarian 
agency wishing to help in Albania, the newspaper reported. 
 
The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a 
Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month 
to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind 
of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, according to 
U.S. intelligence officials.The evidence, the officials said last 
week, shows that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical 
plant in Khartoum, has had financial dealings with members of Islamic 
Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination there 
of President Anwar Sadat in 1981.A spokesman 
for Idris denied the accusations, saying Idris had no ties either 
to bin Laden or to any Islamic terrorist groups.Some State Department and CIA 
officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based 
on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden. 
Senior administration officials 
say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence 
of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, 
but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. 
Officials say U.S. intelligence 
has received reports that Idris launders money for international Islamic 
groups, and that he also has a stake in a company in Sudan that is 
40 percent owned by the Military Industrial Corporation, a government 
entity that the United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons 
development.Bin Laden has helped finance the Military Industrial 
Corp. in his effort to use Sudan as a base for chemical weapons production, 
and talked to Sudanese leaders about testing poisonous gases against 
U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, according to U.S. intelligence.But they said that Islamic Jihad had now been consolidated into bin 
Laden's terrorist campaign. 
 
One of the clear but unstated objectives of last August's raid on 
Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and as many of his lieutenants 
as possible, administration officials now acknowledge.The officials said the raid was 
timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps 
at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would 
be meeting there with his chief operatives.But officials said the White House legal opinion 
drafted before the Afghan strike asserts that the president has authority 
to target the ``infrastructure'' of terrorist groups that are attacking 
Americans.``As 
we said from the time of the Aug. 20 strike, the objective was to 
disrupt the training, organization and infrastructure of the bin Laden 
terrorist network at the Khost camps,'' said David C. Leavy, a spokesman 
for the National Security Council at the White House.U.S. intelligence officials say they now believe that 
bin Laden was in the camp on the day of the attack, but he appears 
to have left unscathed before the missiles hit.Officials said there 
were reports that at least one of his senior lieutenants may have 
died in the attack, and that total casualties in the complex were 
between 50 and 100.Administration 
officials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill 
bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors 
with leading a global war against U.S. interests.But a 
less subtle explanation was offered on Oct. 13 by Defense Secretary 
William Cohen, who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United 
States had been ``going after'' bin Laden and his colleagues.That review, officials said, 
provided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the 
meeting at which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would 
be gathered.He was worried, 
he wrote in an angry dispatch, about the security of the ``East Africa 
network'' of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of masterminding a 
worldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans.The writer, who 
federal authorities believe was Haroun Fazil, who was to become one 
of the central suspects in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi 
a year later, noted with alarm British press reports about the arrest 
of an aide to bin Laden.Striking almost bureaucratic tones, he said 
he was worried that ``an important man with close links'' to bin Laden, 
seemed to have ``fallen into the enemy's hands.''He said the Americans 
were breathing down the necks of his associates in Nairobi and that 
he had to take precautions.Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document 
seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against

the United States destroyed Idris' factory in a missile attack following 
the bombing of the U.S. embassies, the officials said.The criticism is also based on the suspicion that the United States 
has poor data on Sudan, as the CIA station there has been closed since 
1995 and the entire U.S. Embassy since 1996.Senior administration officials

in a house where Fazil had been staying, according to papers filed 
in U.S. District Court in New York City.The documents did not make clear whether 
the FBI had translated and read the document before or after the bombings 
of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 
7 of this year.The timing is potentially important because there 
have been mounting questions since the bombings about whether the 
United States adequately followed up warnings of a possible terrorist 
attack on American targets in Kenya.Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document 
seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against 
bin Laden: That he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that

If Osama bin Laden ever stands trial in New York for the bombings 
of the U.S. embassies in Africa and other acts of terror, it is already 
clear who prosecutors will call as a chief witness:The 
government has identified the aide in court papers with the pseudonym 
CS-1, saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret 
proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan.According to the government, 
the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period 
when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere.From the court papers filed 
in the investigation of the embassy bombings in East Africa in August, 
it is clear that the informant has provided crucial information to 
federal investigators.They have cited the source in the papers filed

pre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection 
with the attack.Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the 
alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to attack U.S. targets around the 
world, and Muhammad Atef, the alleged military commander of bin Laden's 
terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, were charged in a separate 238-page 
indictment with murder and conspiracy in the bombings.Bin Laden is 
believed to be living in Afghanistan.Police seized copies of the newspaper 
for reproducing a foreign newspaper interview of Afghanistan-based 
Saudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden, who has been accused by the United 
States of masterminding bombing attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya 
and Tanzania in August.The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania 
and Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he 
has lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban 
militia.The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, 
on Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama 
bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States.The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political 
activity is banned and he has agreed to respect that, the Taliban 
information minister said in a statement Friday.Albania says it has uncovered a terrorist network operated by Osama 
Bin Laden, the Islamic fundamentalist accused of masterminding the 
August embassy bombings in Africa, and that it's members have infiltrated 
other parts of Europe, The Sunday Times reported.Bin 
Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in 1994 
after telling the government that he was head of a wealthy Saudi humanitarian 
agency wishing to help in Albania, the newspaper reported. 
 
The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a 
Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month 
to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind 
of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, according to 
U.S. intelligence officials.The evidence, the officials said last 
week, shows that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical 
plant in Khartoum, has had financial dealings with members of Islamic 
Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination there 
of President Anwar Sadat in 1981.A spokesman 
for Idris denied the accusations, saying Idris had no ties either 
to bin Laden or to any Islamic terrorist groups.Some State Department and CIA 
officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based 
on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden. 
Senior administration officials 
say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence 
of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, 
but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. 
Officials say U.S. intelligence 
has received reports that Idris launders money for international Islamic 
groups, and that he also has a stake in a company in Sudan that is 
40 percent owned by the Military Industrial Corporation, a government 
entity that the United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons 
development.Bin Laden has helped finance the Military Industrial 
Corp. in his effort to use Sudan as a base for chemical weapons production, 
and talked to Sudanese leaders about testing poisonous gases against 
U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, according to U.S. intelligence.One of the clear but unstated objectives of last August's raid on 
Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and as many of his lieutenants 
as possible, administration officials now acknowledge.The officials said the raid was 
timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps 
at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would 
be meeting there with his chief operatives.But officials said the White House legal opinion 
drafted before the Afghan strike asserts that the president has authority 
to target the ``infrastructure'' of terrorist groups that are attacking 
Americans.``As 
we said from the time of the Aug. 20 strike, the objective was to 
disrupt the training, organization and infrastructure of the bin Laden 
terrorist network at the Khost camps,'' said David C. Leavy, a spokesman 
for the National Security Council at the White House.U.S. intelligence officials say they now believe that 
bin Laden was in the camp on the day of the attack, but he appears 
to have left unscathed before the missiles hit.Officials said there 
were reports that at least one of his senior lieutenants may have 
died in the attack, and that total casualties in the complex were 
between 50 and 100.Administration 
officials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill 
bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors 
with leading a global war against U.S. interests.But a 
less subtle explanation was offered on Oct. 13 by Defense Secretary 
William Cohen, who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United 
States had been ``going after'' bin Laden and his colleagues.That review, officials said, 
provided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the 
meeting at which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would 
be gathered.He was worried, 
he wrote in an angry dispatch, about the security of the ``East Africa 
network'' of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of masterminding a 
worldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans.The writer, who 
federal authorities believe was Haroun Fazil, who was to become one 
of the central suspects in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi 
a year later, noted with alarm British press reports about the arrest 
of an aide to bin Laden.Striking almost bureaucratic tones, he said 
he was worried that ``an important man with close links'' to bin Laden, 
seemed to have ``fallen into the enemy's hands.''He said the Americans 
were breathing down the necks of his associates in Nairobi and that 
he had to take precautions.Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document 
seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against 
bin Laden: That he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that 
his operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin Laden's 
door by federal authorities _He said his comrades in East 
Africa ``should know that there is an American-Kenyan-Egyptian intelligence 
activity in Nairobi aiming to identify the names and residences of 
the members who are associated with the sheik since America knows 
well that the youth who lived in Somalia and were members of the sheik's 
cell are the ones who killed Americans in Somalia.''The government has asserted that one of Fazil's duties was to prepare 
and transmit reports to bin Laden and his top lieutenants.Federal 
authorities said that Khalid al Fawwaz, a London-based associate of 
bin Laden, directed Fazil to ``report periodically to bin Laden about 
the ``security'' situation of the cell.He repeatedly 
expressed his fears of American intelligence, which he believed was 
in the midst of a worldwide search for bin Laden and his associates. 
He said that 
the group did not have to inform its Nairobi-based operatives of all 
its global plans, but they needed enough warning to go ``underground 
for a while'' if authorities intensified the pressure in Nairobi. 
According to the government, 
the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period 
when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere.They have cited the source in the papers filed 
to support the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who are 
under arrest in Germany and Britain.Bin Laden, a Saudi exile, is 
thought to be living in Afghanistan.The source is also the basis 
for many of the significant charges in the indictment against bin 
Laden himself, including the assertion that he directed the attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and that he attempted to obtain nuclear 
weapons.But at least one operative 
of bin Laden's group in East Africa concluded more than a year ago 
that he knew the identity of a crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, a businessman 
who was married to one of bin Laden's relatives.In an August, 1997 article, The Daily 
Telegraph said Tayyib had been in custody in Saudi Arabia since May 
and had given intelligence officials details of bin Laden's bank accounts 
and businesses.``An important man with close 
links to'' bin Laden ``seems to have fallen into the enemy's hands, 
and we have to take all the appropriate security precautions against 
that,'' the operative, Haroun Fazil, wrote in his summary of security 
concerns.In one recent filing, they said their case 
will in part be ``based on the testimony'' of the confidential source, 
suggesting that the informant has agreed to testify at any trial of 
bin Laden or his associates.There is no indication that the source 
has yet been sentenced and it seems likely that sentencing would take 
place after the investigation and ensuing trials are complete.In 
the affidavit prepared last week, the source acknowledged pleading 
guilty to terrorism charges in the United States and said they stemmed 
from attacks on U.S. targets, which were not specifically identified. 
","And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, the man 
Washington calls Enemy No. 1 and blames for the Aug. 7 bombings of 
U.S. embassies in East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said an 
interview with The Associated Press.``America fears its shadow ... in every 
part of the world it is afraid and sees every danger connected to 
bin Laden,'' he said in an interview in the Afghan capital of Kabul. 
The Taliban have refused 
to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there 
is evidence they will try him under Islamic law.Saqib said his inquiry will 
wind up on Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence against bin Laden the 
case will be closed _ at least for the Taliban.``It is too shameful for America who is now seen by all that 
world to have no reason to go after bin Laden.''The official, 
who could not be further identified, said the questioning was aimed 
at gathering recorded testimony to be used by the prosecution in the 
pre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection

of President Anwar Sadat in 1981.This evidence was uncovered after 
the United States destroyed Idris' factory in a missile attack following 
the bombing of the U.S. embassies, the officials said.But intelligence 
agents previously obtained evidence that the manager of the Shifa 
plant made frequent trips to Iraq, where he visited the head of the 
chemical weapons program.In addition, a soil sample that the CIA 
clandestinely took at the Shifa plant showed the presence of a chemical 
used in the production of VX nerve gas, a process used only by Iraq.

the FBI had translated and read the document before or after the bombings 
of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 
7 of this year.The timing is potentially important because there 
have been mounting questions since the bombings about whether the 
United States adequately followed up warnings of a possible terrorist 
attack on American targets in Kenya.He refers to himself as the media information officer of the East 
Africa cell and complains that he is not being kept in the loop on 
big decisions.Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document

the ``security'' situation of the cell.A translation of the report was part of a 
package of documents American prosecutors have sent to Britain to 
support the extradition of Fawwaz for trial in New York.The author noted with alarm a recent 
CIA operation in which a man accused of shooting agency employees 
had been lured across the border in Pakistan and returned to the United 
States for trial.He said that 
the group did not have to inform its Nairobi-based operatives of all 
its global plans, but they needed enough warning to go ``underground 
for a while'' if authorities intensified the pressure in Nairobi. 
If Osama bin Laden ever stands trial in New York for the bombings 
of the U.S. embassies in Africa and other acts of terror, it is already 
clear who prosecutors will call as a chief witness:The 
government has identified the aide in court papers with the pseudonym 
CS-1, saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret 
proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan.According to the government, 
the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period 
when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks

Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination there 
of President Anwar Sadat in 1981.Some State Department and CIA 
officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based 
on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden. 
The criticism is also based on the suspicion that the United States 
has poor data on Sudan, as the CIA station there has been closed since 
1995 and the entire U.S. Embassy since 1996.Senior administration officials 
say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence 
of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, 
but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. 
Officials say U.S. intelligence 
has received reports that Idris launders money for international Islamic 
groups, and that he also has a stake in a company in Sudan that is 
40 percent owned by the Military Industrial Corporation, a government 
entity that the United States says controls Sudanese chemical weapons 
development.Bin Laden has helped finance the Military Industrial 
Corp. in his effort to use Sudan as a base for chemical weapons production, 
and talked to Sudanese leaders about testing poisonous gases against 
U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, according to U.S. intelligence.One of the clear but unstated objectives of last August's raid on 
Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and as many of his lieutenants 
as possible, administration officials now acknowledge.The officials said the raid was 
timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps 
at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would 
be meeting there with his chief operatives.But officials said the White House legal opinion 
drafted before the Afghan strike asserts that the president has authority 
to target the ``infrastructure'' of terrorist groups that are attacking 
Americans.``As 
we said from the time of the Aug. 20 strike, the objective was to 
disrupt the training, organization and infrastructure of the bin Laden 
terrorist network at the Khost camps,'' said David C. Leavy, a spokesman 
for the National Security Council at the White House.U.S. intelligence officials say they now believe that 
bin Laden was in the camp on the day of the attack, but he appears 
to have left unscathed before the missiles hit.Officials said there 
were reports that at least one of his senior lieutenants may have 
died in the attack, and that total casualties in the complex were 
between 50 and 100.Administration 
officials have denied since August that the raid was intended to kill 
bin Laden, a Saudi exile who has been charged by federal prosecutors 
with leading a global war against U.S. interests.But a 
less subtle explanation was offered on Oct. 13 by Defense Secretary 
William Cohen, who said during a visit to Saudi Arabia that the United 
States had been ``going after'' bin Laden and his colleagues.That review, officials said, 
provided the legal basis in August to fire cruise missiles into the 
meeting at which it was believed bin Laden and his lieutenants would 
be gathered.He was worried, 
he wrote in an angry dispatch, about the security of the ``East Africa 
network'' of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of masterminding a 
worldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans.The writer, who 
federal authorities believe was Haroun Fazil, who was to become one 
of the central suspects in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi 
a year later, noted with alarm British press reports about the arrest 
of an aide to bin Laden.Striking almost bureaucratic tones, he said 
he was worried that ``an important man with close links'' to bin Laden, 
seemed to have ``fallen into the enemy's hands.''He said the Americans 
were breathing down the necks of his associates in Nairobi and that 
he had to take precautions.He refers to himself as the media information officer of the East 
Africa cell and complains that he is not being kept in the loop on 
big decisions.Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document 
seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against 
bin Laden: That he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that 
his operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin Laden's 
door by federal authorities _He said his comrades in East 
Africa ``should know that there is an American-Kenyan-Egyptian intelligence 
activity in Nairobi aiming to identify the names and residences of 
the members who are associated with the sheik since America knows 
well that the youth who lived in Somalia and were members of the sheik's 
cell are the ones who killed Americans in Somalia.''The government has asserted that one of Fazil's duties was to prepare 
and transmit reports to bin Laden and his top lieutenants.Federal 
authorities said that Khalid al Fawwaz, a London-based associate of 
bin Laden, directed Fazil to ``report periodically to bin Laden about 
the ``security'' situation of the cell.It is not 
clear from the materials whether the report in the computer was forwarded 
to bin Laden.He repeatedly 
expressed his fears of American intelligence, which he believed was 
in the midst of a worldwide search for bin Laden and his associates. 
He said that 
the group did not have to inform its Nairobi-based operatives of all 
its global plans, but they needed enough warning to go ``underground 
for a while'' if authorities intensified the pressure in Nairobi. 
According to the government, 
the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period 
when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere.From the court papers filed 
in the investigation of the embassy bombings in East Africa in August, 
it is clear that the informant has provided crucial information to 
federal investigators.They have cited the source in the papers filed 
to support the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who are 
under arrest in Germany and Britain.The source is also the basis 
for many of the significant charges in the indictment against bin 
Laden himself, including the assertion that he directed the attacks 
on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and that he attempted to obtain nuclear 
weapons.But at least one operative 
of bin Laden's group in East Africa concluded more than a year ago 
that he knew the identity of a crucial turncoat: Sidi Tayyib, a businessman 
who was married to one of bin Laden's relatives.``An important man with close 
links to'' bin Laden ``seems to have fallen into the enemy's hands, 
and we have to take all the appropriate security precautions against 
that,'' the operative, Haroun Fazil, wrote in his summary of security 
concerns.In one recent filing, they said their case 
will in part be ``based on the testimony'' of the confidential source, 
suggesting that the informant has agreed to testify at any trial of 
bin Laden or his associates.There is no indication that the source 
has yet been sentenced and it seems likely that sentencing would take 
place after the investigation and ensuing trials are complete.In 
the affidavit prepared last week, the source acknowledged pleading 
guilty to terrorism charges in the United States and said they stemmed 
from attacks on U.S. targets, which were not specifically identified. 
","U.S. prosecutors have asked for a 20-day extension 
to provide Germany with paperwork necessary to extradite a top lieutenant 
of Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden, officials said Saturday. 
Saqib, who heads a judicial inquiry established by the Taliban to 
investigate the terrorism charges against bin Laden, says the United 
States has become insecure.``America fears its shadow ... in every 
part of the world it is afraid and sees every danger connected to 
bin Laden,'' he said in an interview in the Afghan capital of Kabul. 
The Taliban have refused 
to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there 
is evidence they will try him under Islamic law.Saqib said his inquiry will 
wind up on Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence against bin Laden the 
case will be closed _ at least for the Taliban.The official, 
who could not be further identified, said the questioning was aimed 
at gathering recorded testimony to be used by the prosecution in the 
pre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection 
with the attack.Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the 
alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to attack U.S. targets around the 
world, and Muhammad Atef, the alleged military commander of bin Laden's 
terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, were charged in a separate 238-page 
indictment with murder and conspiracy in the bombings.Police arrested two journalists and charged them with writing articles 
to encourage Muslim youths to stage an Islamic revolution in Bangladesh 
after the Taliban model in Afghanistan, a police officer said Thursday. 
Police seized copies of the newspaper 
for reproducing a foreign newspaper interview of Afghanistan-based 
Saudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden, who has been accused by the United 
States of masterminding bombing attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya 
and Tanzania in August.Men must grow beards of a certain length and criminals 
are subjected to amputations and public executions Even though Bangladesh 
is a predominantly Muslim country, it is governed by secular laws. 
The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania 
and Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he 
has lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban 
militia.``It's 
over, and America has not presented any evidence,'' Afghanistan's 
chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press in an 
interview at the Supreme Court building in the Afghan capital, Kabul. 
The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political 
activity is banned and he has agreed to respect that, the Taliban 
information minister said in a statement Friday.The minister, Amir 
Khan Muttaqi, also disputed U.S. assertions that bin Laden is a rich 
man, saying the Saudi dissident has had his foreign assets frozen, 
a claim not immediately corroborated. 
 
Albania says it has uncovered a terrorist network operated by Osama 
Bin Laden, the Islamic fundamentalist accused of masterminding the 
August embassy bombings in Africa, and that it's members have infiltrated 
other parts of Europe, The Sunday Times reported.He 
said he believed terrorists had already infiltrated other parts of 
Europe from bases in Albania through a traffic in illegal immigrants, 
who have been smuggled across the Mediterranean to Italy in huge numbers. 
Apparent confirmation 
of the Bin Laden's activities came earlier this month during the murder 
trial of Claude Kader, 27, a French national and self-confessed member 
of Bin Laden's Albanian network, the newspaper said.Bin 
Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in 1994 
after telling the government that he was head of a wealthy Saudi humanitarian 
agency wishing to help in Albania, the newspaper reported. 
 
The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a 
Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month 
to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind 
of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, according to 
U.S. intelligence officials.The evidence, the officials said last 
week, shows that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical 
plant in Khartoum, has had financial dealings with members of Islamic 
Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination there 
of President Anwar Sadat in 1981.But intelligence 
agents previously obtained evidence that the manager of the Shifa 
plant made frequent trips to Iraq, where he visited the head of the 
chemical weapons program.Some State Department and CIA 
officials have objected to the decision, arguing that it was based 
on tenuous evidence of a connection between the plant and bin Laden. 
Senior administration officials
